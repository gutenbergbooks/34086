<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Whether or not we believe
that events are consciously
ordered before their occurrence, we
are compelled to admit the importance
of Contingency in human affairs.</p>

<p>If we believe in such an orderly
and predetermined arrangement, the
small circumstance upon which a
great event may hinge becomes, in
our view, but the instrumentality by
means of which the great plan is
operated. It by no means sets aside
the vital influence of chance to assume
that "all chance is but direction
which we cannot see."</p>

<p>For instance, the believer in special
providences regards as clearly providential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
the flight of the flocks of
birds which diverted the course of
Columbus from our shores to those
of the West Indies; but it is none
the less true that this trivial circumstance
caused the great navigator to
turn his prow.</p>

<p>Those who, on the other hand, reject
the idea of special providences,
and treat history as a sequence of
occurrences emerging mechanically
from the relations of men with one
another, must admit that causes forever
contend with causes, and that
the nice balance of action and reaction
may sometimes be influenced
radically by even so small a circumstance
as the cackling of the geese of
Rome. It is true that the evolutionist
is apt to become a believer in necessity
to an extent which appears unlikely to
the mind of the other. Events, in his
view, inhere in the nature and character
of men, these in their turn being
the result of the physical circumstances
that differentiate the nations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
This view seems at first to reduce
the probability that accident will at
any time sensibly alter the course of
affairs.</p>

<p>But if we take historical action
and reaction at their moments of
equilibrium, we see that the tide of
affairs may sometimes appear to follow
the drift of a feather. Consider,
for instance, the declaration of the
Duke of Wellington that the issue of
the battle of Waterloo turned upon
the closing of the gates of Hugomont
Castle by the hand of one man. Wellington
was certainly in a position to
know if this was true; and in the
light of the tremendous events that
depended upon the trifling act, does it
not appear that accident for one moment
outweighed in consequence any
necessity that inhered in the character
of the French people or that of
the nations arrayed against them at
Waterloo? It may be the function of
Contingency to correct the overconfidence
of the evolutionist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>At all events, we cannot dismiss
the "if"; there is, as Touchstone
says, much virtue in it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>IF THEMISTOCLES HAD NOT BEATEN<br />
ARISTIDES IN AN ATHENIAN<br />
ELECTION</h3>


<p>Mithra instead of Jesus! The
western world Zoroastrian,
not Christian! The Persian Redeemer,
always called the Light of
the World in their scriptures; the
helper of Ahura-Mazda, the Almighty,
in his warfare with Ahriman,
or Satan; the intercessor for
men with the Creator; the Saviour
of humanity; he, Mithra, might have
been the central person of the dominant
religion of Europe and modern
times, but for certain developments
in Athenian politics in the years between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
490 and 480 B. C. For it is true
that in the first three of four centuries
of the Christian era the western world
seemed to hesitate between the religion
of Mithra and that of Christ;
and if the Persians had completed
the conquest of Greece in the fifth
century B. C., Mithra might have so
strengthened his hold upon Europe
that the scale would have been turned
forever in his direction.</p>

<p>What was it that enabled the
Greeks, in the crucial test, the ultimate
contingency, to turn back the
Persians and maintain their independence?
History says that it was
the result of the battles of Marathon
and Salamis, in which the Greeks
were triumphant over the Persians.
This is true only in a limited sense.
The battle of Marathon, in 490 B. C.,
did not save Greece, for the Persians
came back again more powerful than
ever. At Thermopylæ, Leonidas and
his band died vainly, for the hosts
of Xerxes overran all Greece north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of the isthmus of Corinth. They
took Athens, and burned the temples
on the Acropolis. They were triumphant
on the land.</p>

<p>But at Salamis, in the narrow
channel between the horseshoe-shaped
island and the Attican mainland,
Themistocles, on the 20th day of
September, 480 B. C., adroitly led
the great Persian fleet of six hundred
vessels into a trap and defeated it in
as heroic a fight as ever the men of
the West fought against the men of
the East. Seated on his "throne,"
or rather his silver-footed chair, on
a hilltop overlooking the scene, Xerxes,
the master of the world, beheld
the destruction of his ships, one by
one, by the leagued Greeks. When
the battle was over he saw that the
escape of his victorious army from
the mainland was imperiled, and
while there was yet time, he led his
Persian horde in a wild flight across
his bridge of boats over the Hellespont.
The field of Platæa completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the check, and the Persian invasions
of Europe were over forever.</p>

<p>What was it that enabled Themistocles
to win this decisive victory for
Greece after disastrous defeats on
land? Simply his skill in the politics
of Athens. Themistocles was a Hellenic
imperialist. He was opposed by
Aristides, who was a very just man,
and an anti-imperialist and "mugwump."
Greece was at that time
terribly menaced by the Persian
power, and threatened with "Medization,"
or absorption into the Persian
nationality. Themistocles saw
that the country's only chance lay in
a union of all the Hellenes, and in
the construction of a navy worth the
name. Aristides was a better orator
than he, and at first won against him
in the Athenian elections. The Greek
spirit was innately hostile to anything
like centralization or imperialism.
But when Ægina, which was
the leading Grecian maritime state,
and had some good ships, turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
against Athens and defeated it on
the sea, the Athenians' eyes began
to open. Themistocles pushed his
plan for the construction of a fleet
of two hundred vessels and the addition
of twenty new ships every
year to this navy.</p>

<p>Squarely across his path stood Aristides,
with his ridicule of the attempt
of little Athens to become a maritime
power, and his warnings against militarism.
But Themistocles, by adroit
politics, led the Athenians to become
sick of Aristides, and persuaded them
to ostracize or banish this just man.
Aristides went to Ægina. Then Themistocles
rushed forward his plan of
naval reform, and carried it through.
The two hundred ships were built,
and not a moment too soon. It was
this fleet, brilliantly led by Themistocles
and Eurybiades at Salamis,
which entangled the Persians in the
narrow waters of Salamis and defeated
them, and saved Europe for
the Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>The victory saved it also for Christ,
by keeping alive the worship of the
half-gods of Greece and Rome until
a whole-god came from Judæa. The
Persians, too, had a whole-god. Idea
for idea, principle for principle,
tenet for tenet, dream for dream, all
of later Judaism and all of medieval
Christianity, except the person and
story of Jesus, was in the religion of
Persia. Not only the central ideas of
formal Christianity, but many of its
dependent and related principles, are
found in Mithraism, which was the
translation of the fundamental philosophic
ideas of Zoroastrianism into
terms of human life. The parallel is
so striking that many thinkers regard
Christianity merely as Mithraism
bodied forth in a story invented
by, or at least told to and believed
by, a circle of primitive and uneducated
zealots who knew nothing of
the history of the doctrines they were
embracing.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the philosophic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
likeness, the acceptance of
Mithraism as it was held and practiced
in Persia in Darius's time, instead
of Christianity, which may
have been Mithraism first Judaized
and afterward Romanized, would
have made a vast difference with
the western world. If Greece had
been Persianized before the rise of
Rome's power, Rome, too, would
have been Persianized. The influence
of Hebrew thought upon the
western world would have been
forestalled. Zoroastrian rites would
have prevailed. Over all would
have spread the mysticism of the
East.</p>

<p>Our civilization might have risen
as high as it has ever gone, in art,
in the grace of life; but instead of
being inspired with the eager desire
of progress, by the restless Hellenic
necessity of doing something better
and higher, or at least something
other, something new&mdash;instead of this,
the spirit of peace and of satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
with old ideals would have permeated
our systems and our life.</p>

<p>Lord Mithra, too, would have been
primarily the sun, primarily an embodiment
of the light shining down
to us through the sky from that central
essence which alone can say, "I
am that I am," and not, as in the
Lord Christ, a humble, suffering, poor
and despised man lifted up into Godhead.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>IF THE MOORS HAD WON THE BATTLE<br />
OF TOURS</h3>


<p>The most tremendous contingencies
in all history&mdash;the determination
of the fate of whole continents,
whole civilizations, by a single
incident&mdash;are sometimes the occurrences
that are most completely and
signally ignored by the ordinary citizen.
For instance, it does not occur
to the man on the street that but for
a turn in the tide of battle on a certain
October day in the year 732, on
a sunny field in northern-central
France, he, the man on the street,
would to-day be a devout Mussulman,
listening at evening for the muezzin's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
call from a neighboring minaret,
abjuring pork and every alcoholic
beverage, and shunning stocks
and all kinds of speculation as prohibited
forms of gambling.</p>

<p>Islamism would to-day, but for a
single hard-fought battle and its
issue, probably be the established
form of religion in all Europe. Even
England would have been unable to
resist the onset of the impetuous
Arabs, once they had established
themselves in triumph from the
Tagus to the Vistula; and the conversion
of all Europe would have carried
with it the Moslemizing of the
new world&mdash;supposing, indeed, that
America had up to this time been
discovered under Moorish auspices,
which is unlikely.</p>

<p>Europe was certainly nearer to
conquest by the Moors in the eighth
century than most people suppose.
There are few finer or more heroic
episodes in history than the extraordinary
series of conquests by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of which, a handful of fanatical Arabs,
inspired by the prophet Mohammed,
carried, with fire and sword, the faith
of Islam over the world, until, within
two hundred years of the date of the
prophet's birth, it reigned from the
shores of the Atlantic to the banks of
the Indus. Horde after horde of impetuous
warriors of the Crescent had
arisen. Their purpose, frankly, was
to convert the world, and convert it
by force. Cutting themselves off
from their bases of supply, and relying
upon an alliance of miracle and
rapine to sustain them, their triumphant
campaigns were one continuous
and colossal Sherman's march to
the sea.</p>

<p>They struck Europe at the east, and
also by way of the west. Greek fire
checked them at the gates of Constantinople
in the east, but they overran
all northern Africa, crossed the
Straits of Gibraltar, and flowed like
a torrent over Spain and southern
France. By the year 731, as Gibbon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
truly says, the whole south of France,
from the mouth of the Garonne to
that of the Rhone, had assumed the
manners and religion of Arabia.</p>

<p>Abd-er-Rahman, the conqueror,
reigned supreme in southwestern
Europe. Spain and Portugal had
been annexed to Asia, and now the
turn of France had surely come.</p>

<p>But at this crisis a heroic figure
arose in Europe&mdash;scarcely an elegant
figure, though a picturesque one.
The throne of the Franks had been
seized by an illegitimate son of old
King Pepin, a rough and heedless
fighter, whose rule pleased the people
better than did that of the priests
and women whom Pepin had left
behind him. This bloody-handed
usurper was named Charles, or Karl,
and he was destined afterward to be
called Martel, "the Hammer," on account
of the iron blows that he struck
upon all who faced him.</p>

<p>Abd-er-Rahman, the victorious
Moor, advanced into northern France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
overthrowing armies with ease, and
sacking cities, churches and convents
as he marched. Nothing could stay
him, as it appeared. He had planted
the standard of the prophet at the
gates of Tours, which is one hundred
and thirty miles, as the crow flies,
from Paris. But meantime the usurping
and base-born Charles, in command
of a small army mostly composed
of gigantic and well-seasoned
German warriors, was sneaking
along, like an Indian, under the
shelter of a range of hills, toward
the Saracen camp; and one day, to
Abd-er-Rahman's great surprise,
Charles fell upon him like a veritable
hammer of red-hot iron.</p>

<p>Not in one moment, nor in one day,
was the issue decided. Six days the
armies fought, and through all Abd-er-Rahman
and his fanatical horde
held their own. But on the seventh
day Charles led a battalion of his
biggest, fiercest Germans straight
against the Moorish center. Abd-er-Rahman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
himself was slain; his army,
appalled by this circumstance, was
broken and beaten, and faded away
toward the South.</p>

<p>Charles Martel made sure his victory
by another successful campaign.
The Moors were driven out of France
forever. In their stead Charles himself
reigned. He had saved Europe
to Christianity. Yet for his lack of
docility, the church execrated him.</p>

<p>If Abd-er-Rahman had overrun
France, as he would surely have done
if a less redoubtable and terrible antagonist
than Charles Martel had
faced him at Tours, he would next
have turned his attention to Germany.
With its fall, Italy and Rome
would have invited his attention.
There he would have found few but
priests to oppose him, and the empire
of the East, attacked in the rear as
well as in the front, would speedily
have succumbed. No Saint Cyril
would have gone forth to convert
the Russians and Bulgarians, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
would promptly have been Tartarized.</p>

<p>As we have seen, nothing could
have saved England or Ireland. The
prophet's world-conquest must have
been accomplished.</p>

<p>What then? Would the western
world have remained at the stage of
cultivation in which we see Arabia
to-day? There is no reason to suppose
that that would have been quite
the case. It was not so in Moorish
Spain, which rose to a high level of
culture. Christianity would not have
been suppressed. It was not suppressed
in Turkey or Spain. But it
would probably have been ruled,
dominated, forced into odd corners,
and to some extent Moslemized.
Learning would not have languished,
for in certain important forms it
flourished in Spain. The western
brain, the Aryan genius, must have
had its way in many intellectual respects.
Yet the cast of European
thought would surely have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
sicklied over with oriental contemplativeness.</p>

<p>The "hustler" never could have
existed under Moslem rule. The
speculator never would have risen,
because he would not have been tolerated.
The Moslem doctrine forbids
censuses and statistics, treating them
as a form of wicked curiosity concerning
the rule of God on earth.
Pictorial art, and sculpture, which
the Koran regards as idolatrous,
would have been sternly repressed.
Literature would have been great
along the line of poetry; science
great along the line of mathematics.</p>

<p>The western woman would have
been orientalized. So far from forming
clubs, she would not have been
permitted even to pray in the
mosques.</p>

<p>America would have remained undiscovered
for centuries; and if at
last accident or search had laid it
bare, it would have followed the path
of Europe. The mellifluous tones of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the muezzin's cadence, "La ilah 'i il
'Allah," "There is no god but God,"
would echo now where the shouts and
yells of the Wall Street speculators
reverberate. And the abode of the
mighty would have been a House of
Quiet, not the home of strenuousness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>IF KING ETHELRED OF ENGLAND HAD NOT<br />
MARRIED THE NORMAN EMMA</h3>


<p>Not much turns upon the marriage
of kings in these days.
The German Kaiser is not the less
German assuredly because his mother
was an Englishwoman. Nor did her
marriage to the Crown Prince of
Prussia give Prussia or Germany the
slightest hold upon England.</p>

<p>It was altogether different in an
earlier day. One royal marriage in
particular, that of King Ethelred the
Redeless, the "Unready," of England,
to Emma, the daughter of
Richard the Fearless, Duke of Normandy,
in the year 1002, exercised
upon Britain and the world the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
tremendous influence. It led to the
invasion and subjugation of England
by William, surnamed the Conqueror,
and to the reconstruction of that
mother country of ours, politically,
socially and racially, upon new lines.
No royal marriage, perhaps, ever had
such enduring and far-reaching consequences;
no queen-elect ever took
with her to her adopted country such
a lading of fateful changes.</p>

<p>The marriage was a sufficiently
commonplace affair in itself. Ethelred
was a smooth and rather gentle
prince, who thought much more of
his own easy fortunes than of anything
else. He wanted a wife, and he
did not like the Danes, who were
racially and politically the nearest
neighbors of his royal house. He
visited Normandy, and must have
pleased the Duke, for Richard, a bold
and resourceful man, bestowed this
fair-haired Emma, a lineal descendant
of the victorious Norse pirates, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
now quite Frenchified, upon the young
Englishman.</p>

<p>She was not destined to see her
progeny long reign over England.
But it did not matter about her descendants.
The great change did not
come with them. What she really did
was to supply to her nephew, Duke
William, known to history as the Conqueror,
who was yet to come to the
throne of Normandy, a pretext to
seize the English crown for himself.</p>

<p>William was of illegitimate birth.
His mother was Arvela, a poor girl
whom Duke Robert saw washing
clothes in the river one day and
straightway became enamored of.
But on his father's side William was,
through Emma's marriage, cousin of
King Edward the Confessor, son of
the unready Ethelred. On a lucky
day for him he visited England. It
was at a time when Edward was very
ill, and William claimed ever after
that he had received from Edward,
on his sick bed, a solemn promise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the Norman duke should succeed
him upon the English throne.</p>

<p>Edward had no son, but it appears
quite unlikely that a wise ruler such
as he was should deliberately have
given away the throne and country
to a foreigner, especially when his
brother-in-law Harold, Earl of Wessex,
a capable man, stood ready to
succeed him. The English, at any
rate, took this view of the matter, for
they straightway made Harold king,
ignoring the claim of the vilely born
Duke William to the throne.</p>

<p>But as the world knows, William
was able to make good his flimsy
claim. Whether Edward gave him
the crown or not, Stamford Bridge
and Hastings did give it him. When
at last, following the law of the time,
he presented himself to the suffrage
of the English nation, the representatives
of the beaten people had no
option but to elect him. He was a
part of the baggage that Queen
Emma brought with her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>What was the rest of it? For one
thing, union and consolidation, centralization.
England up to that time
had been but a broken congeries of
earldoms or tribal territories, and
would have gone on thus if it had
not at last found a master. In the
next place, William brought the touch
of France, of Rome, of the graceful
Latin world, to England. This son
of a hundred pirates passed on to
England the torch of a culture that
had been lighted in Greece and relumed
in Rome. It was not for nothing
that what had been ox meat with
the Saxons now became beef for the
English; what had been calves' flesh
became veal, and base swine flesh reappeared
as a more elegant dish
called pork. It meant something that
the rude language of Beowulf was to
be succeeded by the smoother lilt of
Chaucer&mdash;that, in short, the English
had a new and bookish tongue.</p>

<p>It meant, in simple truth, the disappearance
of the old England and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the birth of a new and greater nation.
"It was in these years of subjection,"
says Green, "that England
became really England." The Normans
degraded the bulk of the English
lords, but they made these displaced
nobles the nucleus of a new
middle class. At the same time their
protection led to the elevation into
the same middle class of a race of
cultivators who had been peasants.
Furthermore, the Norman rule expanded
villages into towns and cities,
and these in time began to stand, as
powerful boroughs, for the rights of
the people. The conquest, says Green,
"secured for England a new communion
with the artistic and intellectual
life of the world without her.
To it we owe not merely English
wealth and English freedom, but
England herself."</p>

<p>Edward A. Freeman calls the Norman
conquest "the most important
event in English history since the
first coming of the English and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
conversion to Christianity." If the
succession of native kings had continued,
says the same authority,
"freedom might have died out step
by step, as it did in some other lands.
As it was, the main effect of the conquest
was to call out the ancient
English spirit in a new and antagonistic
shape, to give the English nation
new leaders in the conquerors
who were gradually changed into
countrymen, and by the union of the
men of both races, to win back the
substance of the old institutions
under new forms."</p>

<p>In other words, the Norman Princess
Emma brought with her John
Bull as a part of her dowry, when
she came to weak Ethelred as his
bride.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>IF COLUMBUS HAD KEPT HIS STRAIGHT<br />
COURSE WESTWARD</h3>


<p>On the morning of the 7th
day of October, 1492, Christopher
Columbus, sailing unknown
seas in quest of "Cipango," the Indies,
and the Grand Khan, still held
resolutely to a course which he had
laid out due to the westward. This
course he held in spite of the murmurings
of his crew, who wished to
turn back, and contrary to the advice
of that skilled and astute navigator,
Martin Alonzo Pinzon, who
commanded the <i>Pinta</i>. Pinzon had
repeatedly advised that the course
be altered to the southwestward.</p>

<p>Columbus was sailing on a theory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Pinzon, like any other practical navigator
in a strange sea, was feeling his
way, and answering the indications
of the waters, the skies, the green
grasses that drifted on the surface
of the waves, the flocks of birds that
wheeled, and dipped, and showed
their heels to the far-wandered navigators,
and seemed to know their
way so well over that remote and
uncharted wilderness of the deep.
Columbus had said, "We will sail
to the west, and ever to the west,
until the west becomes the east."
Which to the men before the mast
was sheer lunacy. But Pinzon had
already found strange Afric lands.
The scent of their leaves and flowers
seemed to lie in his nostrils.</p>

<p>Martin Alonzo Pinzon put off in a
boat, later on that 7th day of October,
and came back to the <i>Santa Maria</i>,
in which was the Admiral. He
brought the information that he had
seen "a great multitude of birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
passing from the north to the southwest;
from which cause he deemed
it reasonable to suppose that they
(the birds) were going to sleep on
land, or were perhaps flying from
winter which must be approaching
in the countries from which they
came." The Admiral knew it was
by the aid of the flight of birds that
the Portuguese had discovered the
greater part of the new lands which
they had found. Columbus hesitated,
wavered.</p>

<p>Had the heart of the great theorist,
sailing obstinately straight west in
obedience to the call of the land
whose presence there he had reasoned
out, misgiven him at last? Had the
discouragement and incredulity of
his men affected him? We do not
know. But we do know that finally
he heeded Pinzon's oft-repeated demand
that the course be altered.</p>

<p>It looked like common sense to follow
the birds. Really it was not.
The theory was his true guide.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Columbus betrayed his faith; he resolved,
as his journal recorded, "to
turn his prow to the west-southwest,
with the determination of pursuing
that course <i>for two days</i>." He never
resumed the westward course. He
had weakened in his devotion to his
own idea&mdash;and had lost a continent
for Spain and the Roman Catholic
Church.</p>

<p>For in spite of the conclusion
reached by John Boyd Thacher, in
his monumental work on Columbus,
that even if the Admiral had held the
westward course his fleet would not
have passed the northernmost tip of
the Bahamas, there is sufficient
ground for the generally accepted
conclusion that his landfall in that
case would have been on the coast
of Florida or South Carolina, or even
North Carolina. After the alteration
of his course, Columbus continued to
sail for four days in a general southwesterly
direction, before, on the 12th
of October, he fell upon Watling's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Island. In that time he had sailed,
according to his own reckoning, one
hundred and forty-one leagues. This
distance, if persisted in due to
the westward, would have brought
him in contact with drift and real
bird-flight indications of the continent.</p>

<p>Let us see toward what point his
course had been laid. Setting sail
from Gomera, in the Canary Islands,
Columbus purposed to go straight
to the west until he reached land.
Gomera lies in about the latitude of
Cape Canaveral, or the Indian River,
Florida. A line drawn from Gomera
to Cape Canaveral passes to the northward
of the Bahamas altogether. No
land lay in the Admiral's path to
Florida.</p>

<p>But any supposition that Columbus
would not have gone to the
northward of the Indian River ignores
the northward drift that the
Gulf Stream would have caused his
ships. He had yet, of course, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
reach the axis of that powerful current,
which is here comparatively
narrow, and runs very swiftly at the
point where the due westward course
from Gomera would have struck it.
It is a fair chance that this drift
would have carried Columbus so far
north as to land him in the neighborhood
of what is now Charleston, S. C.,
or even further to the northward, if
he had followed the path he had laid
out for himself.</p>

<p>Amazing the consequences that
hung upon the flight of those "multitudes
of birds" that wheeled Bahama-ward
on that October day! The Admiral's
landfall on the coast even of
Florida would have made all temperate
America Spanish, for it would
have focused the might of Ferdinand
and Isabella upon our shores. We
know that the islands which lay immediately
to the southward of his
"Salvador," in the Bahamas, beckoned
Columbus in that direction, and
that the Indians were able by signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to make it clear to him that a greater
land, which was Cuba, and which he
called "Cipango," lay in this southerly
direction. That way he laid his
course, "in order," as he wrote in
his journal, "to go to this other
island which is very large and where
all these men whom I am bringing
from the island of San Salvador make
signs that there is a great deal of
gold and that they wear bracelets of
it on their arms and legs and in their
ears and in their noses and on their
breasts."</p>

<p>Reason enough! Only it meant
that Spain's energy in this hemisphere
was to be directed to the West
Indies, and South America, and
Mexico, for as long a time as it was
destined to endure, and that the vast
continental North was to be left as
the heritage of another race.</p>

<p>It is true that Florida afterward
became Spanish. But it was not a
question of what Florida, merely, was
to be. If Columbus had landed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
the mainland, the northeastward
trend of the coast, reaching back
toward Spain by just so much, would
have beckoned him northward, not
southward. Even if he had explored
southwardly, by some chance, he
must have returned northward when
he had reached the point of the
Florida peninsula; and in the northerly
direction he would have cruised,
returning Europe-ward. And he
would have annexed the land step by
step, as he annexed Cuba, Hispaniola,
and all the southern lands as fast as
he touched them.</p>

<p>The Carolinas, Virginia, Maryland,
would have been the scenes of the
Spaniards' settlement for a hundred
years. Though afterward they took
Florida, that was as a mere side issue;
it was unconsidered, neglected, after
Cuba and Mexico; and was passed
on at length to the race that came to
the mainland more than a hundred
years after the landfall at San Salvador.</p>

<p>Who can estimate the consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of a fate which should have sent
Columbus straight on his way! Who
can compass the thought of the millions
of country-loving Americans of
our race unborn here, but nurtured
under skies now foreign to their very
nature, but for that glittering flock
of tropical birds whirling southwestwardly?
It is no idle conjecture;
von Humboldt, one of the wisest of
cosmographers, says that never in
the world's history had the flight of
birds such momentous consequences.
"It may be said," he avers, "to have
determined the first settlements in
the new continent, and its distribution
between the Latin and Germanic
races." He believed that the Gulf
Stream would have carried Columbus
around Cape Hatteras. It might
indeed have done so.</p>

<p>We of the United States may well
believe that the hand of Providence
guided those birds on that October
day; but none the less are we compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
to admit the strange dependence
of human events upon circumstances
that are most trifling in themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>IF QUEEN ELIZABETH HAD LEFT A SON<br />
OR DAUGHTER</h3>


<p>Never did greater events hinge
upon a woman's caprice
against marriage than those which
were poised on the will of Elizabeth,
Queen of England, in the long years
that lay between the time when, as
a young queen, it was proposed to
marry her to the Duke of Anjou, and
the sere and yellow leaf of her
womanhood, when her potential maternity
was past.</p>

<p>If Elizabeth had married, as her
people often implored her to do, and
if her progeny had sat upon the
throne and continued the sway of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Tudors, half a century of turmoil and
bloodshed, under the essentially foreign
rule of the Stuarts, might have
been spared to England. The Revolution
doubtless would never have taken
place. The material and intellectual
advance of England and all Britain
would have been steady and sure
upon the splendid foundation of the
Elizabethan structure.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, as good is
often evolved from evil, much that is
sacred and vital to the whole Anglo-Saxon
race might have been missed.
The Bill of Rights, the Habeas Corpus
Act and other guarantees that
were obtained through the Revolution
or the Commonwealth would have
been wanting in the English Constitution.
Oliver Cromwell and John
Hampden would probably have remained
in rustic obscurity. All modern
Europe would have lacked the
political incentive, the revolutionary
impulse, the constructive audacity,
which it has derived from the Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
Remonstrance, from the battlefields
of Marston Moor and Naseby, where
royalty was overthrown by the arm
of the common people, and from the
eternal menace that lay in the death-block
of King Charles.</p>

<p>It was not because of any aversion
to the society of men that Elizabeth
remained unmarried. Very far from
this; it is likely that her extreme
liking for male society cut a considerable
figure in her refusal. She did
not propose to give any man a public
right to interfere with her liberty of
choice in this regard. History agrees
that there was a sting of truth in the
words of Mary, Queen of Scots, in a
letter which she once sent to Elizabeth:
"Your aversion to marriage
proceeds from your not wishing to
lose the liberty of compelling people
to make love to you." The queen
was fickle and passionate. She had
little fear of the royal Mrs. Grundy.
At the tender age of sixteen scandal
linked her name with that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Lord Admiral Seymour in such a way
that an investigation by the council
was necessary. She baffled the lawyers
in the examination by her "very
good wit."</p>

<p>From the time of her accession, at
the age of twenty-five, to the time of
her death, Elizabeth was certainly
never without a favorite. She had
small conscience, and there can be
little doubt that she required the assassination
of poor Amy Robsart in
order that her favorite, Dudley, might
be free from his young wife; and
when, after the age of sixty, her
young cavalier of that time, the fascinating
Essex, wearying of dancing
attendance upon her at court, joined
the expedition of Drake against Portugal,
the Queen bade him return instantly
at his "uttermost peril." In
the end she signed the unhappy
Essex's death warrant for an alleged
rebellion against her.</p>

<p>But her motive in refusing matrimony
was not altogether&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
not even chiefly&mdash;one of coquetry.
She was avid of power, and could
brook no rival in its exercise. It is
probable that considerations of real
patriotism restrained her from marrying
a continental prince. She
shrank from introducing foreign influence
as instinctively as Americans
have at all times. She shrank from
bowing to any yoke of Europe. But
there were also objections to her marrying
an Englishman. If she had
chosen one she would have aroused
the jealousy of all Englishmen not of
his party or following. She regarded
it as the better policy to keep them all
hoping.</p>

<p>The unmarried state suited her arrogant
and domineering nature well.
She had none of the docility which
made Queen Victoria a model house-wife
and mother, and also a model
constitutional sovereign. It was her
purpose to have undivided power or
none. To the deputation of the House
of Commons which visited her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
a petition that she marry, she answered:
"For me it shall be sufficient
that a marble stone declare that a
queen, having reigned such a time,
lived and died a virgin."</p>

<p>The Commons who uttered the petition
must have felt a premonition of
what would actually take place if
there were no heir of Elizabeth's
body. The next heir to the throne
was Mary, Queen of Scots. She was
a zealous Catholic, and England had
just fully established its religious independence.
It is true that Mary's
son and heir, James, who afterward
became King of England, as well as
of Scotland, was a Protestant, but
the loyalty of the adhesion of his
house to the new confession might
well have been distrusted. There
was no promise of happiness for
England in the accession of a prince
or princess of this house to its
throne.</p>

<p>But the Stuarts came&mdash;and the
troubles of England began in real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
earnest. Elizabeth's reign had been,
as it then seemed to all Englishmen,
and as in very many respects it was,
the golden age of Britain. Never had
art, and literature, and material prosperity,
risen to so high a level. The
world seemed opening to a new and
glorious life, like a rose bursting into
bloom. In literature it had been the
age of Shakespeare and Bacon. But
with the Stuarts, literature and art
passed into a long eclipse. Shakespeare's
light may be said to have
gone out for a hundred years, to be
lighted again only from the borrowed
torch of German culture.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that Elizabeth had
been able to find a consort as wise
and as harmless as was Prince Albert,
the husband of Queen Victoria.
Let us suppose that the pair had left
behind them a thoroughly English
prince, their own son, a man who
would have been capable of continuing
Elizabeth's prudent rule and of
holding England to its traditions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
while maintaining the extraordinary
advance that had marked her splendid
reign. Without James's mingled
poltroonery and tyranny to nurse and
stimulate it, it is doubtful if Puritanism
would have had its spasm of ascendency.
English history would
have been spared an epoch of chaos,
of wild experimentation, of political
empirics.</p>

<p>At the same time it would have
been deprived of a form of political
genius which was hammered out of
the fire of rebellion. English Whiggism,
English liberalism, English
nonconformity have made the world
over anew. America, in particular,
would have been infinitely poorer
without the Puritan ferment. Should
we have had the New England migration
at all, if England had continued
its calm and homogeneous development
under Elizabethan influences?
Would not rather all America have
been like Virginia, and the new world
organized on a roast-beef, plum-pudding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and distinctly Anglican and
conformist basis?</p>

<p>If we can imagine Massachusetts
a purely Episcopal colony to-day,
ruled by parochial vestries instead of
by town-meeting-parliaments and the
village Gladstone and his responsible
cabinet in every hamlet, and the
whole province presided over by some
self-sufficient Sir Alexander Swettenham
as the representative of British
royalty, we may perhaps imagine
England without the cataclysm of the
Stuarts.</p>

of diversion, in the midst of
more serious speculations, let us have
an "if" of musical history&mdash;and one
which, no doubt, musicians may regard
as purely fanciful, totally absurd.
It should be stated at the start
that this chapter is written by one
who has no knowledge of music, but
is capable of a very keen enjoyment
of it, and has in his time heard much
professional music&mdash;many concerts,
operas and oratorios&mdash;and also much
of the spontaneous untrained music
of the people, including old New England
ballads now forgotten; the songs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of German peasants at the fireside
and spinning wheel; the native corn
songs, "wails" and "shouts" of
Southern negroes on the plantations;
and the medicine songs, scalp songs,
ceremonial chants and love ditties of
the American Indians.</p>

<p>The contingency which will be presented
here is this: If a certain group
of unprofessional singers and musicians
in the highly cultivated Italian
town of Vicenza, about midway of
the sixteenth century, had not banded
themselves together in a society called
the Philarmonia, and for the first time
in Europe given musical entertainments
to which the public were admitted,
the musical institution called
the concert might never have existed,
and music in that case would have
remained a spontaneous expression
of human emotion, untainted with
what is now called virtuosity&mdash;that
is, the strife and strain after technical
mastery, which affects the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
character of music, and diverts it
from its original purpose of pleasing
the sense and comforting the heart.</p>

<p>Expert professional music was a
thing of very slow growth. The old
chapelmasters or choirmasters were,
of course, in a sense professional,
since they lived upon the church.
But they had also a sacerdotal character.
At the beginning they were
always priests. To make a class of
professional musicians, vying with
one another for mere mastery, the
public concert, with paid musicians,
had to be developed.</p>

<p>Though the Philarmonia gave public
concerts at Vicenza, as we have
said, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, concert music and opera
music had no general existence for
as much as a century afterward.
The first opera ever represented was
Peri's "Eurydice," written about
1600. Even that was merely the expression
of a group of enthusiasts, a
sort of private attempt to embody a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
theory of their own about what music
should be. It was not until the year
1672 that the first concert, with a
price for admission, was given in
London. The price then charged was
a shilling, and the concert was in a
private house.</p>

<p>By that time the start had been
made. Other concerts were given
soon afterward. They became popular.
There was a demand for skilled
musicians and soloists. Performers
began practicing for the sake of excelling
in technical achievement. By
swift and sudden steps a premium
was put upon mechanical perfection
in the handling of instruments. The
old spontaneous methods of expression
gradually became discredited.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the new development,
two sorts of music grew
up in the world. On the one side
stood concert music, professional
music, virtuoso music. This was difficult
and complicated, and it was impossible
for ordinary people to sing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
it or play it. On the other side was
the popular music&mdash;folk music, the
music of the street, the nursery, the
stable-shed and the taproom. As
popular music was regularly deserted
now for the concert school by those
who possessed the greatest musical
talent, it began to degenerate until it
reached at last the degradation of
"Grandfather's Clock," "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay,"
"Waiting at the
Church" and the graphophone.</p>

<p>On the other hand, concert music
moved farther and farther away from
the hearts and the comprehension of
the people, until it has become a
thing apart from their lives, to be
enjoyed almost as much with the eye
as with the ear, the interest lying
chiefly in the production, in succession,
of individual masters, each of
whom visibly surpasses the mechanical
achievements of his immediate
predecessor.</p>

<p>If those first concerts had not been
given by the Philarmonia at Vicenza,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and the idea had not slowly rippled
outward thence, like spreading circles
from a stone thrown into the
water, until it reached Vienna, Paris
and London, what would have been
the state of music to-day?</p>

<p>Manifestly the development of
church music would have gone on.
The people, no doubt, would have
been taking part in magnificent
chorals. The masses of the Catholic
Church would have their correspondent
feature in the anthems and hymns
sung in the Protestant churches by the
congregations. Every instrument that
existed in the sixteenth century would
have been perfected, but not one
would have taken on the intricate development
which musical mechanism
exacts.</p>

<p>In other words, the harpsichord
would never have become a piano,
and the electrical church organ would
not have been heard of. We should
all play some such instrument as the
harp, the violin, the viol, the flute,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the pipe or the dulcimer. All might
have been composers, as the negroes
and Indians are to-day, but on a
higher plane.</p>

<p>What popular music might be now
but for that unlucky Philarmonia discovery
is suggested by an extract
from the writings of Thomas Morley,
an Englishman who became a great
amateur and introducer of Italian
madrigals in his own country. In
the year 1597 he wrote that, on a
certain evening, in England,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">
<p>supper being ended, and musicke-bookes, according
to the custome, being brought to the table, the
mistresse of the house presented mee with a part,
earnestly requesting mee to sing. But when, after
manie excuses, I protested unfainedly that I could
not, euerie one began to wonder. Yea, some
whispered unto others, demanding how I was
brought up. So that, upon shame of mine ignorance,
I go now to seek out mine old friende master
Gnorimus, to make myselfe his schollar.</p>
</div>

<p>In those days a person who could
not sing, and sing well, was regarded
as a freak, and was required to fit
himself to join in the universal diversion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
If we had not turned over
our music making to professionals it
would be so now. Instead of going
to the concert or the opera after the
evening meal, or playing bridge or
talking scandal, people would have
participated in the singing of madrigals,
glees or whatever other sort of
popular spontaneous music had been
developed, and all would have been
sustained and uplifted by the exalted
joy that comes from joining with
others in the production of good
music.</p>

<p>The people would have been joyously
and heartily musical. Their
taste would not have been degraded
to the point where it is gratified, as
in the graphophone, with a complicated
succession of flat and strident
sounds unmusical in themselves.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>IF THE SPANISH ARMADA HAD SAILED<br />
AT ITS APPOINTED TIME</h3>


<p>When Philip the Second, son of
the great emperor Charles
V, came to the throne of Spain, that
country had become the greatest cosmopolitan
empire in the world. The
throne of Castile, at one time or another
during Philip's reign, was the
throne not only of Spain and Portugal,
but of the Netherlands and Burgundy,
the Sicilies, Sardinia, Milan,
Cuba, Hispaniola, Florida, Mexico,
California, nearly all of South
America, and the Philippine Islands.
The Spanish monarch was the eldest
son of the church; and Philip, strong,
ambitious, bigoted and insolent, expected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
as he laid the foundations of
his glorious palace, the Escorial, the
eighth wonder of the world, to become
master of France and Britain,
and to bequeath to his son the vastest
empire that the sun had ever shone
upon.</p>

<p>By his marriage with Queen Mary
he acquired the nominal title of king
of England, though he was never
crowned. But his grudge rose
against England after Mary's death
and Elizabeth's accession. The
country proved itself a thorn in his
side, helping the Dutch rebels and
undoing at home the persecuting
work of his late spouse. Philip
formed a great project for the invasion
of the country.</p>

<p>Spain was supreme then on the sea.
The English navy had greatly declined.
In 1575 it had but twenty-four
vessels of all classes on the water.
Philip knew the cleverness of the English
with their ships, however, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
planning this invasion he proposed to
be invincible. Invincible he sought to
make the Armada, or fleet, that he
sent against the country, and invincible
not only he, but all Europe, believed
it to be, when, in January of
the year 1588, the great flotilla was
ready to sail.</p>

<p>It consisted of about one hundred
and thirty ships, of which sixty-two
were over three hundred tons burden.
It was commanded by a brave and
skillful sea fighter, Santa Cruz. The
English had bettered their conditions
of seven years before very greatly, but
they were at this moment absolutely
unprepared to meet a foreign fleet.
Their ships were scattered far and
wide, and many were unequipped.
If the Armada had sailed at that moment
it would have found no force
ready to meet it. And it would have
escaped the storms that later befell.</p>

<p>But <i>mañana</i> is the curse of all
Spain's projects. The Armada lingered.
Santa Cruz, its chief, sickened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in port and died. Very likely if he
had sailed no such fate would have
overtaken him. This was the first of
the big fleet's misfortunes. Philip
looked about for another commander.
By a fatuous favoritism his choice
fell upon the Duke of Medina Sidonia,
who was utterly incompetent.</p>

<p>The months flew past. Meantime
the English, fully apprised of the
king's intentions, were getting a
fleet together. In those days it was
not necessary to wait five years for a
battleship to be constructed. Almost
any big ship could be turned into a
fighting craft. In particular, the
English were well off in guns, and
the delay of the Armada gave them a
chance to get their artillery on board.</p>

<p>When&mdash;<i>nombre de Dios!</i>&mdash;does the
reader suppose that this invincible
fleet, ready in January, really set sail
from Coruña? On the 12th day of
July! It had already been scattered
and weakened by a storm off Lisbon.
On the 21st of July Medina Sidonia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
sailed into Drake's and Hawkins's
"line ahead" formation in the English
channel as Rojestvensky sailed
into Togo's lair off Tsu-Shima in
1905, and the result to him somewhat
resembled the subsequent fate of the
Russian fleet in the Sea of Japan. It
was not, however, so bad. If Medina
Sidonia had gone, with his surviving
ships, after the first onset, to Denmark,
and refitted, he might yet have
embarrassed the British. But he
sought to make the passage around
the north of Scotland, and a succession
of storms wrecked his whole remaining
fleet.</p>

<p>All authorities agree that in January,
1588, no English force existed
which could have hoped to check
Santa Cruz as things then stood.
What if he had come on and landed
an army of trained veterans upon
England's undefended shores? He
must have won. Queen Elizabeth
must have been overthrown. Ireland
would have gladly joined Philip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
England was almost half Catholic,
and the people of that faith might
eventually have become reconciled to
the foreigner. Philip might have
made himself another Norman William.
The Spanish culture would
have been imposed upon the English
nation. But unlike William of Normandy,
who transferred his power to
Britain, Philip would have remained
a Spanish sovereign, and London
would have been ruled from Madrid.</p>

<p>Philip would never have temporized
with English Protestantism.
The chances are that he would have
stamped it out utterly and at the
start, as he sought, too late, to do in
the Netherlands. If he might have
worked his will, he would also have
suppressed English learning and literature.
William Shakespeare, who
had just come up to London, had
never produced a play when the Armada
sailed, and probably he never
would have produced one if it had
conquered. The glorious Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
culture would have been nipped in the
bud.</p>

<p>All Britain's possessions in the new
world, already existent or to be,
would have fallen to Spain or France
if Philip had overthrown Elizabeth&mdash;doubtless
to Spain, for Philip's ambition
to seize the French throne would
have been furthered by his conquest
of England. Spanish viceroys would
have borne sway for centuries over
all North America. A hybrid Indian-Latin
race would have arisen here, as
in Mexico and Peru. Lacking the inspiration
of North American freedom,
all Spanish America to the
southward would have remained to
this day under the dons.</p>

<p>Castilian speech, Castilian cultivation,
Castilian manners, the Castilian
faith, might have reigned supreme
over a dusky race from the St. Lawrence
to the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>IF CHAMPLAIN HAD TARRIED IN<br />
PLYMOUTH BAY</h3>


<p>On the 18th of July, in the year
1605, Samuel de Champlain,
in command of a ship of the King of
France, and engaged in the search
for an eligible site for a great settlement,
anchored in the harbor which
was afterward to be known as the
harbor of Plymouth, in New England.
Two days before, he had been
in Boston Bay. He mapped both
these havens, and expressed his approval
of the physical resources, and
also the native Indian peoples, of the
region.</p>

<p>At that time the coast of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
England was really unappropriated,
though soon after it was claimed by
both France and England. It was
merely a question which power should
first seriously undertake the settlement
of the country. If France
planted her colony here, the land was
destined to be French. If England
hers, it would be English.</p>

<p>Champlain carefully studied the
advantages of Boston and Plymouth.
That he thought favorably of the latter
place is proved by the very decent
map, still extant, which he made
of Plymouth and Duxbury waters.
"Port St. Louis," he called the place,
after the patron saint of France, and
after his royal master. It looked
very much as if he hoped that the
spot he so honored would be made
the seat of the French empire in the
western world.</p>

<p>But Champlain sailed away, bearing
with him the blessing of the
thickly settled and sedentary native
people. He passed around Cape Cod,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and went westward as far as Nauset
harbor, near New Bedford. And
then, in due time, he sailed for
France. When, in 1608, he finally
laid the foundations of the city which
was to be the capital of France in
the new world, he did not lay them
at Plymouth or Boston, but at Quebec,
on the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>Why was his choice thus made?
Largely, no doubt, because Champlain,
whose accurate information
and seemingly always wise observation
were greatly trusted by the King
of France, was infatuated with the
noble aspect and vast proportions of
the gulf and river of St. Lawrence.
He was first of all a sailor, and he
had seen nothing to compare with the
magnificence of this great <i>embouchure</i>.
Here were scope and refuge
for the greatest of navies! Here, it
seemed, was a place designed by the
Almighty to be the seat of an empire!</p>

<p>Champlain had an excellent eye
for harbors, but not so good an eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of prophecy for the grand constructive
events that were to be. He left
the Massachusetts coast unappropriated.
First its native inhabitants, so
numerous, so gentle, so industrious,
were decimated by a plague that came
to them from the white men. Only
a remnant survived. And when, in
1620, their sachem, Samoset, shouted
"Welcome, Englishmen!" to the men
of the Mayflower, the Indian king
hailed, unconsciously, the advent of
an empire which was to cast the domain
of New France into a cold and
waning shadow. For Quebec was too
far north, and its hinterland too poor
and restricted, ever to nurse an imperial
race.</p>

<p>What if Champlain had been more
sagacious, and had made his stand on
the coast of Massachusetts? In all
probability the settlement would have
been definitive. The Pilgrims of
Plymouth and the Puritans of Boston,
finding no place for their settlement
in the north, would, in 1620,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
have gone to Virginia or Georgia.
The steely Yankee wedge which, on
one side, was to force the Dutch out
of New Amsterdam, and on the other
the French out of Port Royal and
Acadia, would never have been
driven. New England would have
been French forever, and New York
Dutch.</p>

<p>The principle of the hinterland was
asserted so successfully in our early
history that Massachusetts and Connecticut
were able to claim territory
as far west as the Mississippi River.
It was by means of this hinterland
claim that the young American republic
succeeded in rounding out its
northwestern possessions, after the
War of the Revolution, and obtaining
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin
and Illinois. All these would have
been French if Champlain had made
New England French; and the English
colonies, if they had ever become
strong enough to throw off the
British yoke, would have consisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
of a restricted section in the Southeast.</p>

<p>Indeed, without Sam Adams, Otis,
Warren, and Israel Putnam, without
the revolt against the Stamp Act, and
without Lexington, Concord and
Bunker Hill, it is impossible to conceive
of the American republic at all.</p>

<p>Supposing it to have been constituted
notwithstanding, it would
have had to do without the influence
of the New England town meeting,
the New England common free school,
the New England college, and the
congregational system of church organization.
It would have been deprived
of the work of Franklin, Hancock,
the Adamses, Webster, Sumner,
Garrison, Phillips, Grant and the
Shermans, in its affairs, and of Longfellow,
Emerson, Holmes, Lowell,
Whittier, Hawthorne and Parkman
in its intellectual life.</p>

<p>What would the New England
country and the people have been
like, if Champlain had never turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
back from Plymouth Bay? We know
from Benjamin Franklin's account
what the progeny of the English settlers
had become even as long ago as
1772. "I thought often," he wrote
in that year, "of the happiness of
New England, where every man is a
freeholder, has a vote in public affairs,
lives in a tidy, warm house,
has plenty of good food and fuel,
with whole clothes from head to foot,
the manufacture perhaps of his own
family. Long may they continue in
this situation!" What the Canadian
habitant is to-day, we know. Very
often he is unable to read or write,
and his material and moral condition
very low. Even as late as 1837 the
Canadian provinces were still arbitrarily
ruled by royal governors, with
appointed councils or upper houses
which had a veto on all legislation.
There was no self-rule, and the mass
of the French people were illiterate
and miserably poor.</p>

<p>Sieur Samuel de Champlain did a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
good day's work for English-speaking
America, and the great free republic
that was to be, when he pointed
his prow northward and sailed away,
out of sight of Cape Cod, in the summer
of 1605.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>IF CHARLES II HAD ACCEPTED THE<br />
KINGSHIP OF VIRGINIA</h3>


<p>Once at least the New World
has furnished to the Old
World a reigning, actual king; once,
for thirteen years, a monarch, sitting
on a throne in America, ruled thence
an ancient kingdom in Europe. And
twice this singular thing might have
happened, with this time an enthroned
sovereign on the banks of
the James instead of on the shore
of a Brazilian bay, if a certain king's
son and king-to-be had been of a
somewhat more venturing and less
indolent disposition.</p>

<p>The occasion when the thing really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
happened was when Don John VI,
King of Portugal, removed his royal
throne and all the paraphernalia of
government from Lisbon to Rio de
Janeiro, in 1807 (being impelled
thereto by an intrusive movement on
the part of one Napoleon Bonaparte),
and turned Portugal (after the withdrawal
of the French) into an actual
dependency of Brazil. This it remained
until King John recrossed
the Atlantic in 1820. Throughout
that period the scepter bore sway
from west to east, from America
Europe-ward.</p>

<p>Very much the same thing would
have occurred further north in the
contingency to which I have referred;
and if it had, a royalist or
monarchist influence might have been
laid upon the English colonies in
America which would have colored
their history and institutions in a
marked degree, even if their destiny
had not been permanently affected.</p>

<p>When Charles I, King of England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
was arrested, imprisoned, and put to
death by the Parliament party in
1649, Virginia experienced a shock
of shame and indignation. That colony
had absolutely no sympathy with
Cromwell and his party. It was in
no sense or part Puritan. The Cavalier
sentiment dominated it completely;
for though the bulk of its
inhabitants came out very poor, and
were as far as possible from being
"gentlemen," they were not at all of
the material of which Roundheads
were made; nor had they any influence
in the government of the
Province. The General Assembly
represented the gentlemen of the
colony, who were royalists to a man.</p>

<p>It is not surprising, therefore, that
upon the receipt of the news of the
execution of Charles I, the General
Assembly of Virginia lost no time in
meeting and passing an act in which
the dead king's son, Charles II, was
recognized as the rightful and reigning
sovereign. Legal processes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the machinery of the provincial government,
continued to run in the
king's name. In England, Cromwell
was installed as Lord Protector. But
Virginia refused to recognize him or
his title. At least one county of Virginia
formally proclaimed Charles
king, requiring "all his majesty's
liege people to pray God to bless
Charles the Second, King of England,
Scotland, France and Ireland,
Virginia, New England and the
Caribda Islands." This, I believe,
was the first appearance of the term
"King of Virginia," a title which
was destined to be heard again somewhat
later.</p>

<p>Nor did the people content themselves
with proclaiming Charles king.
In 1650, Governor Berkeley sent Colonel
Norwood to Holland to invite
the prince to become the ruling sovereign
of what Raleigh had called "the
newe Inglishe Nation" on this side
the water. Charles did not accept.
Nor did he frankly refuse. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
not the boldness to go to Virginia,
but he was delighted with the chance
to put on for a moment the manner
and authority of a ruler. He sent
Berkeley a new commission as governor,
signed by himself as king, and
gave Colonel Norwood a commission
as treasurer of the colony. Both commissions
were honored in Virginia.</p>

<p>The colony, indeed, with Barbadoes
in the West Indies, virtually constituted
itself the Dominion of King
Charles the Second; and it is in
memory of that assumption of the
whole kingdom's prerogative, as the
Virginians believe, that the state is
called the Old Dominion to-day.</p>

<p>Nor did the people propose that
their allegiance should remain merely
nominal. They essayed actually to cut
the connection with Cromwell's Commonwealth
and maintain themselves
as the sovereign remainder of the
English realm. They succeeded in
maintaining this position for a considerable
time&mdash;until, that is, 1651,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
when Cromwell's government sent
three ships of war to reduce the Virginians
to submission. As all the
principal settlements were within
easy reach of navigable water, and
had not developed sufficient back territory
by means of which to support
themselves, it was impracticable for
them to hold out long; they were
obliged to submit. Cromwell treated
the province oppressively, and forbade
the other colonies to trade with
it.</p>

<p>It is not at all surprising that Virginia,
which in the meantime had become
the place of refuge of many
more royalists, took steps to throw
off the Puritan allegiance as soon as
possible after Cromwell's death, and
sought to anticipate the restoration
of the Stuarts. Sir William Berkeley,
whom Cromwell had displaced
with a Roundhead governor, was
again called to the head of things by
the people. He refused to assume the
governorship at their mandate unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
they gave him their solemn and formal
promise to venture their lives
and fortunes for King Charles II.
This promise was given him by the
unanimous voice of the electors.
Berkeley then proceeded to proclaim
Charles "King of England, Scotland,
France, Ireland and Virginia."
Virginia was once more the sole existing
segment of the king's dominion.
In Virginia, and in Virginia
only, processes and documents were
issued in his name.</p>

<p>Charles was therefore really king
in Virginia, though in very fact he
was still living a lazy and rather low
life in the Dutch towns, or eating, as
a guest, the bread of the French and
Spanish nobility. The Virginians,
however, were not at all content with
having set up a mere paper sovereignty
for him. Berkeley had kept
in touch, by letter and through messengers,
with Charles, and had sent
word to him, in Holland, before the
Commonwealth had fallen, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
would raise his standard in Virginia
if the king would give his consent.
Once more he offered him a Virginian
crown. Richard Lee was sent to
Holland with a proposition from
Berkeley to take the field for the
king. It was even proposed that
Charles should come to Virginia and
set up his throne there.</p>

<p>The king once more sent cordial
thanks to the Virginians. But he did
not accept their proposition. We can
imagine that along one side of his
nature it appealed to him, and on
the other and commanding side it
was quite unwelcome; that is to say,
while it must have inflamed somewhat
his ambition to be king once
more and have done with the eating
of the bread of others, it was quite
in conflict with his natural indolence
and moral cowardice. His first attempt
to assert his kingship, when,
on the field of Worcester, he was
ignominiously defeated by Cromwell,
had sickened him with all proceedings
having the stamp of energy upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
them. As a matter of fact, it would
have been perfectly safe for him to
raise his standard and set up his
throne in Virginia. But he would
not venture it. He would remain on
the Continent and await the turn of
events.</p>

<p>Ere long events made him king in
England. The Commonwealth fell
to pieces when there was no longer
a strong hand to guide it. Charles
landed shabbily, even squalidly, at
Dover, almost sneaking into the
country, instead of coming in triumph
from Virginia, with a kingly
New World in his hand, as he might
have done if he had accepted Berkeley's
invitation.</p>

<p>If, after his defeat at Worcester,
he had taken advantage of Virginia's
first proffer and of French assistance,
and raised his flag in America,
Charles might have affected the
world's history very materially.
There was no time when the Puritans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
were not in a minority in England.
They held down the majority
for a time because they had developed
a superior military capacity,
and had a splendid, resolute army.
But to the nucleus of a brilliant Cavalier
command in the New World, the
more vigorous English royalists
might have rallied. A court at Williamsburg,
which was then and for a
long time afterward the capital of
Virginia, would have meant a royal
court in London much sooner than it
really arrived, and would have caused
the Commonwealth to leave a fainter
and narrower mark upon the history of
England than in the event it did leave.</p>

<p>Meantime, what a brilliant court
would have assembled around the
gay and talkative monarch at Williamsburg!
Already the Lees, the
Washingtons, the Berkeleys, and
many others of the "first families,"
were established in Virginia.
Charles would probably have been
happy in the easy, light-hearted atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of the plantations. There
were no Puritans there to bother him.
Virginia had made its own laws
against Puritan practices&mdash;and enforced
them.</p>

<p>Never was a monarch who would
have been better pleased with having
about him actual slaves&mdash;men
and women whose bodies he would
have owned. His sway must have
spread northward as far as the border
of the French possessions, for
though New England was Puritan, it
bent reluctantly to the sway of the
Commonwealth, seeming to scent in
the Roundhead sovereignty a kind
of rival that threatened to take over
its half-won autonomy. A kingship
exercised in America would probably
have suited the men of New England
very well.</p>

<p>In all likelihood the throne would
in due time have been transferred to
the mother country. But its erection
here, even for a few years, must have
infused into the character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Americans generally a larger element
of monarchicalism than fell to their
lot as it was. Virginia would hardly
have fallen off so readily into colonial
republicanism as it did in 1774-1776.
English neglect of a really
royalist Virginia sowed the seed of
Virginian rebellion. If Virginia
had not supported Massachusetts,
shoulder to shoulder, there could not
have been an American Revolution.
Charles did not know how far he let
Virginia go when he rebuffed Berkeley's
emissaries.</p>

<p>The sentiment of personal loyalty
to the crown remained strong in the
colonies up to the very outburst of
the Revolution. The Americans dissolved
the relation of subject and
sovereign with regret. If they had
ever had a king whom they could call
their own, the interest enkindled and
perpetuated by his presence might
very well have turned the scale in
1776 and prevented the withdrawal
of the colonies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>IF ADMIRAL PENN HAD PERSISTED IN<br />
DISOWNING HIS SON WILLIAM</h3>


<p>When an English father, irascible
and opinionated, disowns
and turns out of doors a son
who has not only disobeyed him but
proved false to the traditions and
obvious interests of the family, he is
very apt to adhere to his action. A
very great deal turned upon a case,
once, in which an English father,
after making a very firm show of
disowning his son, at last relented
and took him back to his heart.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania, to wit, turned upon
it; and all the amazing success of
William Penn's great experiment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
colonization. There has never been
anything quite like that success in
the world's history, for the great
trek of the already established American
population in the nineteenth century
was a readjustment, an extension,
rather than a colonization in
the true sense. The planting of
Pennsylvania was a true colonization.
Not only did it amount to the creation
of a great and model commonwealth,
full-fledged, with a composite
new-world population, in twenty or
even ten years' time, but it furnished
the keystone to the arch of states
that constituted the American republic
in the next century after
Penn's settlement.</p>

<p>Philadelphia led the American
towns in the seven years of the Revolution.
It was their capital commercially
as well as politically. It
supplied most of the sinews of war.
Without Robert Morris's $1,400,000,
all of which came from Philadelphia,
the final and crucial campaign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the war could not have been fought.
More than that, without just the sort
of commonwealth that Pennsylvania
had already become, standing in the
center of things&mdash;cosmopolitan, independent
of royalist or aristocratic
influence, populous, well-to-do, democratic,
steady&mdash;it is hard to see how
the Revolution could have been undertaken
at all.</p>

<p>But for the incident which permitted
Penn's settlement, the vast
territory which afterward constituted
Pennsylvania would have become
merely an extension of New
York, or of New Jersey, or of Maryland,
or of Virginia, or of all of them.
The chances are that its resources
would have been exploited by slave
labor. The greater part of the state
might have remained slave territory
up to 1861. In any case its development
would have been much more
slow, its peopling much less rapid.
Not only must Indian wars have
checked growth, but the spectacle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the arrival of five hundred thousand
stalwart Germans, the creation of the
largest city in the colonies within
fifty years, and the upbuilding, in
that time, of a trade from the Delaware
River that employed more than
five hundred ships and seven thousand
sailors, could never have been
presented.</p>

<p>The part which Pennsylvania began
to play from the moment of Penn's
arrival, and which it still plays, in
American affairs, was directly dependent
upon Penn's character and
genius, and, for a long time, upon
his wealth and social position. Without
the wealth which William Penn
inherited from his father, Admiral
Sir William Penn, he could not have
organized his Pennsylvania Society,
nor bought the site of Philadelphia.
Without the position, as well as the
wealth, which he inherited, he could
not, in the first place, have aspired
to the acquaintance with and confidence
of King Charles II; and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
were absolutely essential to the extraordinary
charter, in behalf of a
despised and distrusted people, which
Penn received at the king's hands.</p>

<p>Had Penn always been in this favorable
position? We shall see. The
admiral, his father, was a good
churchman and a conservative man.
King Charles held him in very high
estimation. The son was brilliant,
and of noble character. He was sent
to Oxford University; and what was
the father's astonishment, after the
boy had been there some little time,
to hear that he had joined the despised
and persecuted sect of the Quakers!
This was very much as if, at the
present day, the son and heir of a
great multi-millionaire should join,
not merely the Socialists, but the
Anarchists at Paterson!</p>

<p>Sir William raved and scolded.
The son only grew more firm in the
faith. Sir William endured much;
but finding the young man actually
inclined to address the king as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
"thou," he told him that if he committed
this impropriety, or "thee-ed"
and "thoued" either him, the admiral,
or the Duke of York, he would
disown him, and cut him off without
a shilling. On the very first opportunity
after this, young William addressed
King Charles as "thou!"
The king, having a more than royal
sense of humor, made a jest of the
matter, but Sir William did not. He
was as good as his word. He turned
his son out of doors, and bade him
begone. The youth went abroad, and
took up for a time a very much discredited
existence. He had already
been expelled from the university.</p>

<p>Here, for a time, the fate of Pennsylvania
certainly trembled in the
balance. It was quite within the outraged
admiral's power to make the
ban permanent. If he had done so,
there would never have been a
Quaker-German commonwealth in
America.</p>

<p>It is known that the son accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
his banishment as permanent. But
his mother did not. She pleaded
with the father for his forgiveness.
She reminded him of the boy's great
natural goodness, his brilliancy, his
affectionateness. He would, Lady
Penn maintained, recover from his
distemper of Quakerism. She begged
her husband, before it was too late,
to relent and recall him.</p>

<p>At length, moved by this appeal
and the promptings of his own heart,
the admiral called the young man
home. Once or twice afterwards he
was on the point of a more radical
banishment of him. But, fortunately
for the New World, Sir William's
heart was soft after all. The
son was reëstablished in his good
graces. After the admiral's death,
in 1670, it was found that he had bequeathed
all his wealth to the son,
and, owing to the son's influence,
the Quakers improved their position
not a little, and in due time Penn
organized and put through the Pennsylvania<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
experiment. But King
Charles took good care to inform
him that the name "Pennsylvania,"
officially bestowed on the colony, was
not in honor of the founder, but in
compliment to the admiral, his father.</p>

<p>Narrow as this contingency may
have been, since so great an event
depended on the impulse of one man,
it was after all a moral contingency,
and not due of physical accident, as
so many others have been. It is the
more impressive for this reason. It
is good to know that a few heartbeats
the more, in the breast of a
man who can be kind as well as hot-tempered,
may create a mighty empire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>IF THE BOY GEORGE WASHINGTON HAD<br />
BECOME A BRITISH MIDSHIPMAN</h3>


<p>One summer day, in 1746, a
British ship of war lay in
the Potomac River below the place
where the city of Washington now
stands. The officers of the ship had
been visiting at Mount Vernon, which
was the residence of Major Lawrence
Washington, adjutant-general of Virginia.</p>

<p>No vessel of the royal navy entered
the Potomac River without a visit on
the part of its officers to Major Washington's
house. He had been in the
king's service at the siege of Cartagena
and elsewhere. Admiral Vernon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was his friend; Major Washington's
estate on the Potomac had been
named after the admiral. Lawrence
Washington's acquaintance with the
men of both army and navy was wide,
and his popularity among them great.
A visit to his hospitable residence,
where he entertained them with true
Virginian lavishness, was always a
bright spot in any naval officer's life
at that day.</p>

<p>At Lawrence Washington's table,
for two or three years prior to 1746,
had sat his younger brother, George
by name. This lad, who was a gentleman
and a soldier in miniature,
had often listened to stories of the
exploits of the navy&mdash;of the capture
of Porto Bello, of the bombardment
of Cartagena, and of cruisings and
battles along the Spanish Main.
These stories and personal contact
with their heroes had inspired him
with an eager desire to enter the
naval service. His father was dead,
and his brother, who had virtually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
taken the father's place, favored the
boy's design. His mother had opposed
it. But at last she had been
induced to give her consent. A midshipman's
warrant was obtained for
young George Washington, and on
the summer day in 1746 of which we
have spoken his luggage had actually
been sent on board the ship lying in
the river.</p>

<p>But at the last moment Mary Washington
flatly rebelled. She could not
bear the thought of her boy's going
to sea. She foresaw a time when she
would need him at home. She withdrew
her consent; and as her signature
was necessary to his enlistment,
it was impossible for him to join the
ship, and his luggage was sent back
to Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>So thus it happened that George
Washington did not, at the age of
fourteen, enter the British navy, and
embark upon a career which would
probably have held him fast all the
rest of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>It was a real contingency&mdash;that of
the possible commitment of George
Washington to the royal cause.
Every influence that bore upon him,
up to the date of his brother Lawrence's
death, in 1752, was royalist.
This brother was married to the
daughter of George William Fairfax,
cousin and manager of the great
American estates of Lord Fairfax.
Lord Fairfax himself, removing to
Virginia, became the patron, friend
and mentor of young George Washington.
The young man was in constant
association with Englishmen,
and always more or less under official
influence.</p>

<p>The Fairfaxes remained loyal to the
British power when the war of independence
was declared. If Lawrence
Washington had lived it is quite conceivable&mdash;aye,
probable&mdash;that he
would have gone with them. If
George Washington had not been
thrown much into contact after that
with his Virginian neighbors, among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
whom the spirit of rebellion had been
propagated from Massachusetts&mdash;if
he had not himself become a colonial
soldier and commander&mdash;there can be
little question that he would have
clung to the English side.</p>

<p>In the meantime, undoubtedly, he
would have been advanced to rather
high rank in the naval service, if he
had joined it. The years between
1746, when the midshipman's warrant
was obtained for Washington,
and 1774, when the colonies began to
flame up into revolt, had been of great
activity at sea.</p>

<p>The young officer might have participated
in the destruction of the
French fleet at Cape Finisterre; in
the victory off Lagos; in the great
decisive combat in Quiberon Bay; in
the capture of Havana, and in many
other sea fights. He would have
fought by the side of Boscawen, Sir
Edward Hawke, Lord Howe, Duff
and Rodney, and very likely have
won laurels such as theirs. Nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
colonial could have separated him
from the flag which he had thus
served, any more than the influence
of his native state could have separated
Farragut from the Stars and
Stripes in 1861.</p>

<p>Is it too much to say that the
American republic would have been
fatherless without Washington? Perhaps
an arm might have been found&mdash;though
that is doubtful&mdash;that
could have wielded his sword. But
where was the brain, the patience,
the tact, the determination, that
would have composed the differences
in the American councils, and have
kept the discordant colonies and the
jealous commanders together?</p>

<p>That another man, that any combination
of men, could have done
what he did, is inconceivable. In the
grandeur of his character and in the
genius with which he accomplished
a tremendous work, he is uncompanioned
not only in America, but
in the history of the world. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
his steadying hand in the war, the
American army would have followed
a devious course to death, and the
young republic one to its destruction.</p>

<p>As to the decisive part which he
played in the formation of the union
of the States after the war, the word
of his companions in the Federal
Constituent Convention is conclusive.
"Were it not for one great character
in America," said Grayson of Virginia,
referring to Washington, "so
many men would not be for this government;
we do not fear while he
lives, but who besides him can concentrate
the confidence and affection
of all Americans?" No one else ever
could have concentrated them. Monroe
reported to Jefferson, "Be assured
Washington's influence carried
this government." And Bancroft has
put this judgment on record: "The
country was an instrument with thirteen
strings, and the only master
who could bring out all their harmonious
thought was Washington.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Had the idea prevailed that he would
not accept the Presidency, it would
have proved fatal."</p>

<p>Washington was the pivot upon
which all things turned. Lacking
such a pivot, the machinery of the
American republic would have tumbled
into ruin. Happy the choice of
the Virginian mother who could not
spare her boy on that summer day,
and sent aboard the man-of-war in
Potomac's stream for his dunnage!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>IF ALEXANDER HAMILTON HAD NOT<br />
WRITTEN ABOUT THE<br />
HURRICANE</h3>


<p>"He thought out the Constitution
of the United States and the
details of the government of the
Union; and out of the chaos that existed
after the Revolution raised a
fabric every part of which is instinct
with his thought." So said one of
his contemporaries, Ambrose Spencer,
of Alexander Hamilton; and another
said: "He did the thinking of his
time." The thinking that Hamilton
did for the young American republic
was of the most tremendous and vital
importance to it. His services as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
financier were not merely of a negative
or saving character&mdash;they were
positively constructive and permanently
enduring; he "created a public
credit and brought the resources
of the country into active efficiency."
It was Hamilton who founded the
American system of business and
finance.</p>

<p>Yet it is altogether likely that but
for an accidental circumstance or
two Alexander Hamilton would never
have come to the continental colonies.
He was born on the Island of
Nevis, in the West Indies, and upon
that island, and upon St. Christopher
and St. Croix, neighboring islands,
his life up to the age of fifteen was
spent. His father, James Hamilton,
had proved "feckless and unfortunate,"
as a British biographer of
Hamilton expresses it, and early
ceased to provide for the boy, or, apparently,
to take any interest in his
education or welfare. His mother
died early, and left him to the charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of her relatives, and as she bequeathed
to them several other children,
they had little thought about
Alexander except to make him of
some use and lighten their own burden.
He was sent to school scarcely
at all, and at the age of twelve was
put into the shop or store of Nicholas
Cruger, a general dealer at St. Croix,
to earn his living as a clerk.</p>

<p>There he remained for about three
years. He has often been described
as phenomenally precocious, and he
certainly was, in the sense that his
mind ripened early. But there was
nothing of the quality of smart, self-satisfied
immaturity about his genius.
He read much, studied deeply, and
received some good training at the
hands of Rev. Hugh Knox, a Presbyterian
minister.</p>

<p>But all at once there occurred the
accident which resulted in his going
to the continental colonies. In the
late summer of 1772 a fearful hurricane
swept over the Leeward Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
The boy Hamilton, then fifteen years
old, had his full share in the adventures
attending this calamity, and
wrote a long and vivid account of it
for a newspaper published at St.
Christopher. By this brilliant piece
of news work the entire West Indies
were electrified. The people there
had had plenty of hurricanes before,
but none of them had ever been adequately
"written up." Young Hamilton
awoke one morning to find himself
in the enjoyment of a fame which
extended all the way from Jamaica
to Trinidad.</p>

<p>The immediate result of this notoriety
was to convince Alexander's
relatives that they possessed in him
a prodigy, and to stimulate them to
find means to educate him. They
raised a fund forthwith without any
particular difficulty, and shipped him,
armed with a letter of introduction
from Rev. Mr. Knox, to Boston, en
route to New York. Lacking this
assistance, it is unlikely that the youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
would have found his way to our
shores. Perhaps he would, in spite of
everything, have risen to eminence
in the West Indies. Very likely he
would one day have drifted to Scotland
or England, and he might have
become a famous man there. But
America would have lost him.</p>

<p>There is still another and vital contingency
associated with Hamilton's
removal to the American continent.
On its way to Boston, while in the
open ocean, the ship on which he had
sailed took fire. For some time it was
in danger of destruction. But with
great difficulty the flames were extinguished.
If they had prevailed,
the career of the West Indian genius
would doubtless have been cut short
by death.</p>

<p>Thus, by the aid, first, of a tropical
hurricane, and, second, through the
efforts of the crew of the ship that
bore him, in stifling a fire in the hold,
Alexander Hamilton reached the
American colonies just in time to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
swept into the current of the movement
for independence; to be made
over anew into an ardent American,
and to put his stamp forever upon
the young nation which arose from
the smoke of Bunker Hill. The dark-skinned,
dark-eyed, exotic-looking
student at King's College, whom the
citizens of New York at first looked
at askance as a very "queer West
Indian," became a great leader, a
commander, a guide, a magnificent
constructive as well as restraining
force.</p>

<p>What this country would have been
without him, or rather, what it must
forever have failed to be, may be inferred
from the things which it became
that were owed to him. He was
the inventor of American protection.
American industry was founded upon
his "report on manufactures." As
the first and greatest of Federalists,
he saved the confederation from disruption
by supplying the idea of central
authority. Others might labor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
for freedom&mdash;he labored for security.
He put reason at the bottom of our
commonwealth. Without his principles,
the republic would have lacked
a balance wheel. The States' rights
would have been everything&mdash;the nation's
rights nothing.</p>

<p>All our national expansion was
wrapped up in Hamilton's views.
McKinley and Roosevelt have been
his continuators. The sentiment
which governs our republic to-day is
Hamiltonian; and the war and discord
that have afflicted us, as the result
of the looseness of our confederation,
must long since have wrecked
the nation but for the balance wheel
with which he supplied us.</p>

<h3>IF LA FAYETTE HAD HELD THE FRENCH<br />
REIGN OF TERROR IN CHECK</h3>


<p>In every age of the world, and in
every place, one voice has always
commanded in the affairs of
nations, peoples and communities. If
oligarchies, legislatures, groups or
cabals have seemed to bear sway, it
has nevertheless been true that in
each of these groups, from time to
time, the influence of some individual
has been preponderant. The freest
republics are an organization of this
principle&mdash;a willing submission of the
many to the leadership of chosen men.</p>

<p>In times of stress and strife and
change it is impossible that strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
men should not seize the reins of
power, no matter what political system
exists, no matter what anarchy
tends to prevail. Change, indeed,
makes the opportunity of the strong;
and the fate of nations and continents
depends upon the character of
the strong man who is brought forth.
If he is good, as Washington was
good, his fellow-countrymen derive
lasting and unmeasured benefit from
his grasping of his opportunity. If
he is bad, as Napoleon Bonaparte was
bad, the evil harvest of his vices may
be reaped through generations and
centuries, as France has reaped, and
is now reaping, an inheritance of
strife and national decline.</p>

<p>When the Revolution of 1789 came
to France there were many people, of
all parties and conditions, who believed
that the country had its Washington.
He was to be found, they
thought, in the person of the Marquis
de La Fayette. This man was Washington's
friend. He had successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
copied many of his virtues. He was
unselfishly patriotic. He believed in
the liberty of the people, and wished
to see them govern themselves.
Though himself a nobleman, he believed
in the abolition of titles of nobility.
In his room, and afterward
in his office as a public servant, he
kept two frames hanging on the wall.
In one frame was a copy of the American
Declaration of Independence.
The other frame was empty, but it
bore the legend, "This space awaits
the French Declaration of Independence."</p>

<p>When the Revolution broke out, La
Fayette was called by the people to
the center of real power&mdash;the command
of the troops in Paris. Both
king and people trusted him. His
power for good was almost absolute.
He prevented anarchy and restored
order in Paris after the overthrow of
the Bastile. He gave the country a
Bill of Rights and a Constitution
founded on the American models.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
The quarrels of the warring factions
were stayed by his hand. The mob
dared not turn the king out. La
Fayette's moderating influence was
the ballast that kept the French nation,
in spite of certain excesses, on
a steady keel.</p>

<p>Even when the Girondists and Jacobins
rose and were ready to fly at
one another's throats, the fear of La
Fayette kept these factions from violence.
If he had maintained this influence&mdash;if
he had preserved the
sagacity and boldness to side with
the people and lead them&mdash;the French
nation might have been saved from
anarchy, reaction, the tyrannies of
emperors and of mobs, and the slow
degeneration that has followed its
long diet of gunpowder.</p>

<p>But in the test La Fayette did not
exhibit this power. In 1792 he was
in the field, in command of an army,
resisting the Prussian invasion. The
nation, aroused, was equal to the task
of repelling foreign attack. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Paris events were marching. The
people rose and overthrew the throne
and the royalist Constitution which
La Fayette had made. But they
turned still to La Fayette. They offered
him the chief executive power
in the new government.</p>

<p>This was his opportunity to save
France. He was not equal to it. He
did not rise to the emergency. He
not only refused the offer of power,
but made his troops renew their oaths
of fidelity to the king. Then the Assembly
declared him a traitor; and
La Fayette, taking with him a few
followers, deserted his command,
made his way to Bouillon, on the
frontier, and rode out of France into
a foreign land!</p>

<p>No man can imagine Washington
taking such a step as that. La Fayette
suffered from it, and he afterwards
served his country nobly. But
the eternal mischief of his weakness
had been done. Girondists and Jacobins,
relieved from the fear of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
turned to mutual destruction and
murder. The Reign of Terror was
on. The nation was plunged in an
orgy of blood. Four hundred thousand
men and women were put to
death. Liberty in France was assassinated
in the house of its friends.</p>

<p>One man, I have said, always comes
to the top of things. With La Fayette
gone, Robespierre, the man of blood,
prevailed. Robespierre was the Terror.
And after him, the Terror having
appeased its fearful thirst, and
Robespierre's head having gone into
the basket with his victims', there
came another man to take advantage
of the paralysis the perverted Revolution
had inflicted upon France.
That man was Napoleon Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Bonaparte freed La Fayette from
captivity. Bonaparte held him in
contempt, calling him a "noodle." It
was not so bad as that. But Napoleon
despised a man who had had
his chance and failed to grasp it.</p>

<p>Had La Fayette proved equal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that opportunity, France would have
been organized as a constitutional republic.
The Terror would not have
been. Napoleon's ambition might
have been held in check. The balance
in Europe would have been
maintained, but the leadership of
France would have been consolidated
and become immortal. The nations
would have followed her example.
Monarchy would have died of dry
rot. The dream of a United States
of Europe might have been realized&mdash;perhaps
with a city of La Fayette,
the capital of the vast confederation,
the European equivalent city of
Washington, smiling down, it may be,
from the neutral shores of the Lake of
Constance to east, to west, to north,
to south, with a benediction of peace.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>IF GILBERT LIVINGSTON HAD NOT VOTED<br />
NEW YORK INTO THE UNION</h3>


<p>How many Americans of the
present day realize that the
State of New York, at the time of
the adoption of the national Constitution,
was radically and overwhelmingly
opposed to entrance into the
Union which the Constitution proposed,
and was at last forced into the
league of States only by the demonstration
that the State would be isolated
and cut off from its neighbor
States if it did not join, with a tariff
wall raised against it? It is indeed
hard for New Yorkers to realize, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
they live to-day under the Stars and
Stripes, having forgotten what their
State flag is, and being among the
most zealous supporters of the Union,
that their State led the opposition to
the Constitution, and that but for the
influence of a very few men in two
other States, New York might have
prevented the consummation of that
"more perfect union."</p>

<p>The contingency that prevented the
State from dismembering the Union
at its start was a narrow one, but it
had been provided for. Hamilton
and the Federalists had laid their
plans well. They first furnished the
Southern States, and the smallest
States in the North, with an interested
reason for joining the Union.
They gave the men of the South representation
on their slaves. They
made the little States equal with the
great States in the Senate. Then they
provided that when nine States had
ratified the Constitution it should become
effective, and a confederation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
should be formed by those nine States,
if there were no others.</p>

<p>Then the ratifications began. The
game was to get nine States. Little
Delaware said "Yes" first. Franklin
and Wilson had a firm hold upon
Pennsylvania, and that State entered
next under the pressure they exerted.
New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, Maryland and South
Carolina followed. This made eight
States. Then things stuck fast.
Would there be a ninth?</p>

<p>Two thirds of the delegates in the
convention of New York were firmly
opposed to ratification. They believed
the Constitution meant an end
of the liberties of the States. They
saw a royal throne looming up for
America. They feared, they said, a
great central power which should oppress
and overtax the people of the
States. Governor Clinton led the opposition
to ratification. Hamilton's
able arguments had no effect. New
York would not come in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>All the remaining States were believed
to be also opposed. New
Hampshire had refused to comply
with the requisitions of the Confederation;
why should it look
with more favor on the Constitution?
In Virginia, Patrick Henry
led the opposition to ratification
with impassioned eloquence. Richard
Henry Lee, William Grayson,
George Mason and James Monroe,
all great men in the State,
were unalterably opposed to ratification.
It certainly looked black
for the Union.</p>

<p>But in this moment of apparent triumph,
while the New York convention
was in session, Governor Clinton
and his party in the convention heard
surprising news. New Hampshire,
under the influence of Massachusetts
and of the wiser counsels of some of
its own leaders, ratified the Constitution
on the 21st of June, 1788&mdash;more
than nine months after the
adoption of the instrument by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Constitutional Convention at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>This event put a new face on the
situation in New York. The Union
was now decreed. If New York did
not enter it, she must be prepared to
stand alone, as an independent nation.
Could she do that? The new
Confederation would hem her in on
both sides. To it would belong New
Jersey, which flanked her only seaport
on the west, and Connecticut and
Massachusetts, which walled her in
on the east. The shape of the State
adapted it very badly indeed for an
independent position. Moreover, influences
were known to be at work
which would precipitate a hostile
tariff against the States which remained
out of the Union. A few
months later such a tariff was actually
adopted against Rhode Island, which
was treated as a foreign country in
the levying of duties on imports.</p>

<p>New York could not stand that.
Gilbert Livingston and a few others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
changed their votes under a distinct
announcement that the pressure of
"sister States" had made it impracticable
to continue the opposition.
But even at the last, the Constitution
was ratified by a majority of only two
in a vote of sixty! Gilbert Livingston
held the fate of the State in
his hands, and he, though pledged
against the Union, put New York
into the Union by his vote.</p>

<p>One vote would have kept New
York out.</p>

<p>We have noted the fact that New
York's position was unfavorable for
an attempt at independence. But the
fact that the voice of but one man
prevented the attempt shows that the
other opposing delegates were not
much afraid of making the leap. Supposing
Gilbert Livingston had voted
the other way, and the vote had been
thirty-one to twenty-nine against ratification,
instead of the same figure in
its favor? What would have resulted?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Let us see. Two other States were
radically opposed to the Constitution&mdash;Rhode
Island and North Carolina.
Very likely they would have been
glad to form a defensive alliance with
New York. Virginia ratified a few
days after New Hampshire, but she
might easily have retracted her ratification,
for she had no heart in it.
With Virginia, the malcontent States
would have had (census of 1790) a
population of 1,550,306, against 2,378,908
for the remaining colonies, including
Vermont, which was not yet
in. This would not have been an utterly
hopeless foundation for a new
league, constituted on the easy terms
upon which, and upon which only,
these States were willing to enter the
Union. The want of contiguity of territory
would have been the worst objection
to the formation of the league.</p>

<p>But the real effect of New York's
self-exclusion, so narrowly prevented,
would have been a negative one. It
would have prevented all cohesion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
in the new Union. It would have
driven a wedge straight through the
new republic, from west to east.
Worse, it would have erected secession
into a principle from the start.
Ere long we should have had at least
three republics instead of one, and
probably more. Politically we should
have been what Central and South
America are now. Real progress
would have been barred. Wars
would have been probable between
the States. European political influences
would have penetrated the
weaker States, or alliances of States.</p>

<p>In short, the "American idea,"
government of the people by the people
and for the people, would probably
have been stillborn. By his
change of vote, Gilbert Livingston
signed the death warrant of the principle
of secession. Not only did he set
going the unifying influences which
prevailed over State sovereignty, but
he decreed the Empire State, destined
to be a bulwark against disunion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>IF THE PIRATE JEAN LAFITTE HAD JOINED<br />
THE BRITISH AT NEW ORLEANS</h3>


<p>After the battle of New Orleans,
on the 8th of January,
1814, General Andrew Jackson, the
victorious commander, called before
him a certain officer, of dashing and
Frenchy appearance, and publicly
thanked him for the important part
which he had borne in the battle. To
judge from the signal honor done to
this man, the credit for the victory
was in no inconsiderable part due to
him. And, indeed, this was the case.</p>

<p>The man to whom the victor's
thanks had been thus conspicuously
awarded was Jean Lafitte, the Baratarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
pirate. That the success of
Jackson in defeating and virtually
destroying the army of Pakenham,
consisting of the very flower of
the Duke of Wellington's soldiery,
hinged, in an important sense, upon
this extraordinary corsair and buccaneer,
has never been adequately
acknowledged in American history.</p>

<p>Jean Lafitte, the foremost of the
three pirate brothers of Barataria,
was a man of extraordinary influence
and popularity among the French and
other Latin inhabitants of Louisiana
and New Orleans. He was a native of
France, and a brave and chivalrous
corsair, as corsairs go. A price had
already been put upon his head by
the American governor, Claiborne.
But so secure was Lafitte in the affections
of the Creole people, whom he
served in many ways, that he frequently
attended parties and receptions
in New Orleans. Arriving, on
such occasions, in the full splendor
of his outlaw state, and bringing joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
to the heart of every lady in the
room by his attractive manners as
well as by his fame, the pirate chief
would practically defy the authorities
to lay a hand upon him. If
agents of the law were sent to arrest
him, he knew of it, through a
hundred spies, long before they
reached the place, and withdrew at
once to some near-by hiding place
which was well known to him. In
New Orleans he had a hundred safe
places of refuge.</p>

<p>Under his command was a force of
pirates who were many or few, according
to the exigencies of the moment;
for they could masquerade as
peaceful fishermen if necessary, or
they could, upon occasion, muster a
force of several hundred at a word's
notice&mdash;always perfectly armed, perfectly
drilled, thoroughly redoubtable.</p>

<p>Lafitte preyed impartially upon all
the commerce of the Gulf of Mexico,
and, when pursued, ran into one of
the numerous mouths of the Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
or some inlet of the Gulf&mdash;into
Barataria Lake, into Bayou Lafourche,
or into Bayou Teche. There
it was vain to follow him, for the intricacies
of these passages were
known only to his men or to the
dwellers along their shores, who
were in sympathy with him.</p>

<p>When the British descended upon
New Orleans in the autumn of 1813,
they offered Jean Lafitte a captain's
commission in the British naval service,
thirty thousand dollars in money,
a full pardon for past offenses and
rewards in money and lands for his
followers if he would join them in
making war on the Americans. He
could easily have done so. The
French people of Louisiana had no
keen loyalty for the Stars and Stripes
at that time. As Lafitte went they
might have gone. The British knew
this, and made their bait a rich one.</p>

<p>But Lafitte, although Claiborne's
price was on his head, and his brother
Pierre in prison in New Orleans, refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the offer. Instead, he sent the
letters from Captain Lockyer, of the
British navy, making this proposition,
to the Louisiana legislature.
Later, after Pierre had escaped, he
actually joined General Jackson's
nondescript army with a force of
riflemen. He seems to have acted
from a very honest love for the young
American republic.</p>

<p>Jackson, at first, under a misapprehension
of the circumstances, had
refused to accept the aid of these
"hellish banditti," as he had called
Lafitte's men in a proclamation on
his arrival. But when he found that
the British were upon him, and that
a considerable proportion of his
poorly equipped militia were without
flints for their muskets, he not only
accepted the flints that Lafitte sent
him, but gave the pirate an important
command on his right wing. There
Jean and his men performed signal
service.</p>

<p>If Lafitte had joined the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
with his men and ships, there is little
likelihood that the Americans would
have had in this fight the powerful
aid of the vessels of war <i>Carolina</i>
and <i>Louisiana</i>, on the river. Nor is
it likely that they would have had
the passive support of the French
population. Nor that they would
have found any substitute for the
flints with which Lafitte supplied
them. And it is very likely that the
British assault upon Jackson's intrenchments
would have been attended
with a different result.</p>

<p>Jackson, indeed, might have been
crushed very much as Windsor had
been crushed at Washington, not long
before.</p>

<p>Such a result at New Orleans
would not have affected the outcome
of the war, for a peace favorable to
the American arms had already been
declared at Ghent. But how profoundly
a defeat would have influenced
the personal and political fortunes
of Andrew Jackson and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
events in American history which
hung upon his subsequent career!</p>

<p>General Jackson won the presidency
in 1828 because he was the
military hero of the day. His popularity
was due to the brilliant victory
that he won at New Orleans.
After his defeat in 1824, a spectacular
visit which he made to the field
of the 1814 battle renewed the souvenirs
of the great fight and intensified
his popularity; and in 1828 he
was triumphantly elected. If he had
been defeated in battle by Pakenham,
and New Orleans had been
taken, his fame would have been extinguished
then and there.</p>

<p>And without Jackson&mdash;should we
ever have had machine politics? It
was he who introduced these into our
government. He was the inventor
and discoverer of the spoils system.
"To the victors belong the spoils"
was the maxim of his lieutenant,
Marcy, and his own principle of action.
We have never been able quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
to shake off the system which he fastened
upon the country. Patronage
has been the curse of our politics
from that day to this.</p>

<p>Then there was his determined and
disastrous assault on the United
States Bank. Upon this institution,
which was founded by Alexander
Hamilton, and whose position somewhat
resembled the present position
of the Bank of England, the financial
system of the country depended.
Jackson attacked it as a "wicked
monopoly," as a concrete expression
of the "money power." He succeeded
in wrecking the bank, in
bringing on the panic of 1837, which
wrought untold ruin and disaster to
the people, and in inaugurating in its
place the system of wildcat State
banks and currency chaos which
lasted up to the Civil War.</p>

<p>But Jackson attacked more than
the United States Bank and the principle
that public office is a public
trust. He attacked nullification.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Nullification meant that the States
could refuse to recognize or obey the
laws of the United States. He struck
that dictum hard, when it made its
appearance in South Carolina, and
paralyzed it to such an extent that
the portion of the nation which did
not believe in secession was able to
get its preponderant growth, and organize
its strength, and prevent disunion,
when the test finally came.</p>

<p>Jackson saved the Union by stunning
the nullification snake until the
republic was big enough and strong
enough to trample it under foot. And
that, no doubt, was the greatest event
that hung on the contingency of Lafitte's
choice of sides at New Orleans.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>IF JAMES MACDONNEL HAD NOT CLOSED<br />
THE GATES OF HUGOMONT CASTLE</h3>


<p>According to the Duke of
Wellington himself, the success
of the allies at the Battle of
Waterloo turned on an amazingly
slight contingency, namely, the closing
of a gate or door of wood in
the wall of a building. This fact
was conclusively brought out when,
years after the battle, an English
clergyman, Rev. Mr. Narcross of
Framlingham, died and left in his
will the sum of five hundred pounds
simply "to the bravest man in England."
The executors of the estate
were completely nonplussed. Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
was the bravest man in England?
Doubtless many would have come forward
gladly to claim the distinction
and the legacy, but who was worthy
of them? In their trouble, the executors
applied to the Duke of Wellington
for an answer to the question.</p>

<p>The Iron Duke was not a man to
be beaten by any question whatsoever,
least of all by a military one.
He went back a little in his recollections&mdash;until
he came to the battle of
Waterloo. Then he wrote to the executors
of the Framlingham parson
that that battle was the greatest that
had been fought in recent times.
"The success of it," he went on to
say, "turned upon the closing of the
gates of Hugomont; these gates were
closed in the most courageous manner,
at the very nick of time, by Sir
James Macdonnel; and he is the man
to whom you should pay the five
hundred pounds."</p>

<p>Thereupon the executors went to
Sir James with the money; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
said to them: "I cannot claim all
the credit of closing the gates of
Hugomont. My sergeant, John
Graham, seeing with me the importance
of the step, rushed forward to
help me; and by your leave I will
share the legacy with him." The request
was granted, and the fact was
to this extent judicially established
that Sir James Macdonnel and John
Graham had closed the gates of Hugomont
Castle, thereby settling the
issue of the battle and the fate of
Europe.</p>

<p>Let us see what events hinged upon
this act, and how they depended on
it. The army with which the great
Napoleon faced the miscellaneous assortment
of British, Prussians, Hanoverians,
Dutch and Belgians at
Waterloo was smaller than that of
the Allies, but vastly more efficient
as a whole. Most of the troops of
the Allies were raw, and some of
them were poor stuff indeed. Napoleon's
soldiers were hardened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
practiced, brave and splendidly commanded.</p>

<p>Napoleon had forced the Allies
back at Quatre Bras. He captured
their position at La Haye Sainte. He
perceived that the strategic key to
the whole field of battle was the hill
crowned by the old stone <i>château</i> of
Hugomont. If that could be taken,
Napoleon would be able to attack
and turn Wellington's right flank.
That accomplished, a junction of
Blücher and his Prussians with the
English would be prevented; the
forces of the Allies would be split in
two, and Napoleon would in all probability
defeat them in detail, according
to his time-honored method. The
emperor could easily have finished off
the Austrians in their turn, as he
planned to do; and the combined
European attempt to oust him would
have been frustrated. Thus the Corsican
would have been, probably for
so long as he lived, the master of
France at the least, even if the checks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
he had already received had restricted
his mastery of the rest of the continent.</p>

<p>Knowing well that upon this cast
his fate was staked, Napoleon hurled
his best troops, under Prince Jerome,
against the little old <i>château</i> on the
hill. Again and again they assaulted
it. Twelve thousand men were
launched against the half-dilapidated
castle, which had been pierced with
loopholes for the British riflemen.
And now and here came the crucial
incident whose importance was rated
so high by Wellington. At a moment
when the chief defence of the
<i>château</i> was entrusted to the Coldstream
Guards, under Colonel James
Macdonnel, the French were within a
hair's breadth of taking it. They
pushed against the gate of the castle,
and had actually forced it open, when
the Coldstream Guards charged out
with their bayonets, forcing the advance
rank of the French back a little.</p>

<p>But the French were pouring up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and could no longer be held back at
the point of the bayonet. It was at
this instant, when a slight leeway
had been gained, that Colonel Macdonnel
and Sergeant Graham, under
a galling fire from the French, stepped
forward and with their own hands
closed the <i>château</i> gates, barricaded
them, and thus enabled the troops to
resume their fierce rifle fire from
within.</p>

<p>After this the French made many
more assaults on the heavy gates,
but could not force them open again.
Wellington meanwhile commanded a
general advance, following a fresh
repulse of the French onset; and the
French line was thrown into confusion.
He knew that Blücher was now
at hand&mdash;it was by this time half-past
seven in the evening&mdash;to support
him. Blücher, indeed, arrived,
and attacked and crushed the broken
French right, forcing Napoleon to retreat
in disorder. Thus was completed
the victory which the heroic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
defence of Hugomont had made possible.</p>

<p>The crushing of the British right
wing on this occasion, had Napoleon
been able thus to effect it, would
have reversed a vast deal of history.
It is not necessary to take an extreme
view of the situation to realize this.
On the immediate field, the British,
Dutch and Hanoverians must have
been forced back upon Brussels, and
Blücher would have been unable to
maintain a front against the French.
Even if the remnants of the allied
armies had escaped, and made another
stand, Napoleon must instantly
have regained a degree of prestige
and position that would have enabled
him to consolidate his power at home
and make excellent terms abroad.
Even after Leipsic, when he had
seemed to be utterly beaten, the
powers had been willing to give
him France's "natural frontiers"&mdash;namely,
the Rhine, the Alps and the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>It is likely that Leipsic and Elba
had already taught the emperor wisdom
which would have deterred him
from attempting to carry the boundaries
of his domain once more to the
Baltic, or to parcel out the rest of
Europe among his relatives and dependents.
But within the frontiers
I have named, and west of the Rhine,
he must have remained impregnable;
and all the momentous consequences
which resulted from his defeat must
have been thwarted and turned aside.</p>

<p>Out of the victory of the Allies at
Waterloo came, first, the banishment
and early death of Napoleon Bonaparte;
the placing of Louis XVIII
on the throne of France; the complete
subduing of the Revolution;
the creation of the joint kingdom of
Holland and Belgium (which meant
the modern intensely industrialized
Belgian state, and Leopold, and the
Congo); the aggrandizement and
lasting leadership of Prussia in Germany;
the foundation of the modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Italy through, the annexation of the
Genoese republic to the Piedmont
kingdom; the enlargement of Switzerland
by three cantons taken from
France; the taking of Norway from
Denmark and its bestowal upon
Sweden; the absorption of what was
left of Poland by Russia&mdash;and some
other reparceling of territory in an
arbitrary sense which has nevertheless
for the most part endured. There
is scarcely a political articulation in
Europe to-day which does not date
from Waterloo; new tendencies still
operate which had their inception
then!</p>

<p>Indirectly the consequences were
momentous. The aggrandizement of
Prussia prepared the way for the unification
of Germany and the gradual
atrophy of Austria as a German state.
As I have said, the enlargement of
Piedmont foretokened a united Italy,
and built up another power which has
contributed to the enforced shrinkage
of Austria. The two great constructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
European statesmen of the
nineteenth century, Bismarck and
Cavour, were both the children of
Waterloo.</p>

<p>All these tendencies might have
been working just the other way if
Colonel Macdonnel had not succeeded
in closing the <i>château</i> gates! Yet
more still was in store. Moral and
intellectual consequences of greater
moment, perhaps, than the political
results, impended. The victory of
the Allies was followed by a period
of severe repression of popular tendencies
in Europe. The Holy Alliance,
which became a league of Continental
monarchs against liberal
ideas, was a direct consequence. It
inaugurated reaction everywhere.
And reaction bred in its turn new
and insidious radicalisms. Lassalle,
Marx, St. Simon, and Fourier, Socialists,
and Bakunin and Proudhon, first
of the Anarchists, were the offspring
of the Holy Alliance, nurtured in the
dark corners of Repression's jail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>The course of events in Europe
would have been far otherwise indeed
if Napoleon's veterans, forcing
their way into Hugomont and splitting
the British strength in two, had
prepared the way for a long lease of
the power of that adroit and calculating
master, who knew so well how
to meet popular demands and still
hold his personal sway. In its practical
expression, his system was liberal.
Every peasant proprietor in
France to-day holds his acres by virtue
of Napoleonic legislation.</p>

<p>That does not mean that all would
have been good in France; far from
that. A strange falsity, a theatric
insincerity, lay beneath all the Napoleonic
sentiments and ideals. These
qualities color the thought of France
still. Will she ever be able to escape
them? These tendencies would have
been many times more powerful if Napoleon
had entrenched himself upon
the throne. More than that, they must
have passed to other countries. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
shadow of his eagles might lie athwart
even our America, his insidious ideas
expressing themselves in our politics
and our intellectual and moral life,
if that moment's vast contingency
had gone Napoleon's way at Waterloo.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>IF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S FATHER HAD<br />
MOVED SOUTHWARD, NOT<br />
NORTHWARD</h3>


<p>The two sections in the Civil
War in America were led by
two men, Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson
Davis, the one President of
the United States and the other President
of the Confederate States, who
were born within about one hundred
miles of each other in the State of
Kentucky, and within nine months of
each other in point of time. For it
was in June, 1808, that Jefferson
Davis first saw the light in Christian
County, Kentucky, and in February,
1809, that Abraham Lincoln was born
in Hardin County, in the same State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Samuel Davis, the father of Jefferson
Davis, and Thomas Lincoln, the
father of Abraham Lincoln, were men
of the same English-American origin,
and the families were originally of
virtually the same class, though
Thomas Lincoln, doubtless as the result
of the death of his father at the
hands of the Indians, when Thomas
was a child, had fallen somewhat in
the social scale. Both men became
dissatisfied with material conditions
in Kentucky at about the same time,
and both emigrated with their families.
But Samuel Davis went southward
into Mississippi, while Thomas
Lincoln went northward into Indiana.</p>

<p>That the sons of both these Kentuckians
had in them the fire of
genius, the history of their country
has abundantly proved. Each was
destined by the compelling force of
his character and gifts to play a great
part. Like all other men, each was
molded by his environment. The illiterate
Thomas Lincoln was credited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
by his immortal son with the intention,
in emigrating, to escape from a
slave State. But is it not probable
that the son, deeply preoccupied as he
was in later years with the subject of
the emancipation of the slaves, had
projected backward, by a psychologic
habit common to all mankind, this
idea from his own mind into that of
his father? In all probability no
other motive than that of accident
or convenience&mdash;for Thomas Lincoln
was a poor and rather "shiftless"
man&mdash;impelled Abraham Lincoln's
father to go to Indiana instead of following
the trail which so many of
the more enterprising Kentuckians
were taking to Mississippi or Louisiana.
It was to that section that
enterprise beckoned, for agriculture
was carried on in the Southwest upon
a large scale, and broader plantations
were open to the adventuring settler.
Indiana, on the other hand, was a
"poor man's country."</p>

<p>What if Thomas Lincoln had possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
a little more energy, and a few
more shillings, and had gone to Mississippi
instead of to Indiana and
afterwards to Illinois? What if he
had become a plantation and slave
owner, and had thus subjected his boy
Abraham to the overmastering influence
of a southern environment?
So far as I can recall, Mississippi
never produced an anti-slavery man.</p>

<p>In this event, there would have
been for the national cause, for the
saving of the Union, for the emancipation
of the slaves, no Abraham Lincoln.
On the other hand, the tremendous
power and patience of Lincoln's
nature, the majesty and greatness of
his character, the resources of his intellect,
would in all likelihood have
been added to the sum of the statesmanship
which was enlisted on the
Southern side.</p>

<p>It is even conceivable that Lincoln,
rather than Davis, would have been
the president of the Southern Confederacy.
Only a combination of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
most extraordinary circumstances
made him the nominee of the Republican
party for the presidency in
1860. If he had been the leading
statesman and politician of Mississippi,
his path to the Confederate
presidency, as the success of Davis
proved, would have been comparatively
easy.</p>

<p>Without Lincoln, the anti-slavery
agitation would have gone on just
the same. The Republican party
would have been constituted just the
same. Everything up to the 18th day
of May, 1860, when Lincoln was nominated
for president at the Wigwam in
Chicago, would have gone on just the
same. But lacking Lincoln, what a
world of things afterward would have
happened differently!</p>

<p>In the first place, it is probable
that Seward would have been nominated
for president. Very likely he
would not have been elected; and as
it was Lincoln who "smoked out"
Douglas, it is probable that Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
would have prevailed over all other
Democratic candidates and been
nominated at Charleston and elected
president.</p>

<p>In which case there would have
been no secession, and very likely
no war, either at that time or later.
Slavery would have become intrenched,
to yield, perhaps, in the
end only to economic influences, the
operation of which had already
doomed it.</p>

<p>But if Seward had been nominated
and elected, secession would have
taken place and war would have resulted.
The sort of leader that the
Union would have had in Seward
may be inferred with perfect certainty
from the famous, or rather infamous,
proposition entitled, "Some
Thoughts for the President's Consideration,"
which Seward solemnly
laid before Lincoln less than a month
after his inauguration. This extraordinary
document, one of the most
senseless and wicked programmes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
ever prepared by a man of state, advocated
a change of the national issue
from slavery to a foreign war; it advised
that war be at once declared
against France and Spain, and "explanations
demanded" from Great
Britain and Russia! In order that
this, brilliant programme might be
carried out successfully, Seward suggested
that he himself be made Dictator!</p>

<p>This scheme, I repeat, illustrated
the sort of alternative material that
we should have had, lacking Lincoln.
Chase, indeed, who was also a leading
candidate for the presidency,
would have been wiser. But in no
position that he ever held, after 1860,
did Chase bring forth any of the
fruits of genius. Cameron, of Pennsylvania,
was a greater man, but
did not command general support.
Neither did Edward Bates, of Missouri,
also a western candidate for
the presidency.</p>

<p>The great soldiers who finally triumphed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
in the field as the instruments
of Lincoln's policy and fought
their way to victory for the Union&mdash;Grant,
Sherman, Thomas, Meade,
Sheridan&mdash;would have been ranged
on the Northern side just the same
whether Lincoln or another had been
at the head of affairs. But it is
doubtful whether another president
would have found them out. Lincoln
made his own grave mistakes regarding
men. But he put forward
no general because that general was
<i>his man</i>. He observed and waited.
A man of the people himself, grandly
simple, he somehow nosed out the
men of the same type. All the generals
who proved great were his discoveries.</p>

<p>The structure of Lincoln's achievements
was not, however, the result of
negative circumstances. It did not
rise because things were not just so
and so. It was a positive thing&mdash;the
result of the active operations of a
powerful genius, which the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
recognized before the politicians and
the writers did. In the people's mind,
the war was "Old Abe's" war. It
was Old Abe who stood at the helm.
Congress did not know it, but it was
really working Lincoln's will. The
cabinet did not always know it, but
it was Lincoln who really had his
way. He kept his own counsel. He
carried out his plans.</p>

<p>The people were right. It was Old
Abe who was doing things. And
without him the most important
things would have gone undone. He
was an original creation&mdash;as Lowell
said, a "new birth of our new soil,
the first American." Nature, for
him, threw aside her old-world molds,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And, choosing sweet clay from the breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the unexhausted West,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With stuff untainted shaped a hero new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise, steadfast in the strength of God, and true.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet what could be clearer than
that Abraham Lincoln, who by birth
and inheritance was of the South,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
not the West, might have turned his
strength to the support of quite a
different cause if the accident of fate
had sent him southward, not northward,
in his childhood?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>IF SKIPPER JENNINGS HAD NOT RESCUED<br />
CERTAIN SHIPWRECKED JAPANESE</h3>


<p>Toward the end of the year
1850, Captain Jennings, of the
American bark <i>Auckland</i>, trading in
Asiatic waters, picked up the shipwrecked
crew of a Japanese fishing
vessel, somewhere off the coast of
Japan. The captain was then bound
for the new port of San Francisco,
which the California gold-diggings
had already made an important city.
He continued on his course, and in
due time&mdash;that is to say, very early
in the year 1851&mdash;landed at San Francisco
with his party of refugees.</p>

<p>Here the bright little Orientals were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
more than a nine days' wonder. Few
Americans had ever before seen a
Japanese. That country was at the
time more a "hermit nation" than
Korea herself. Whalers and other
sailors who had been wrecked on the
Japanese coast had been put to cruel
deaths. No white men except the
Dutch had been permitted to trade
with any of the Japanese cities, and
the Dutch trade had fallen into decay.
Japan seemed as far from our
lives as is the planet Mars.</p>

<p>But the Japanese whom Captain
Jennings had humanely rescued were
kindly treated by him, and on the
homeward voyage they had endeared
themselves to him and his crew. He
landed them at San Francisco with
very favorable reports of their character,
conduct and intelligence. The
free-handed miners of that town
wanted nothing better than somebody
or something to lionize. So for a considerable
time the shipwrecked Japanese
had the best of everything in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
San Francisco, until an opportunity
arose to send them, fat and happy,
back to their own country.</p>

<p>A full account of the incident and
of the refugees was published in one
of the San Francisco papers. It fell
into the hands of just one man who
was capable of perceiving the momentous
possibilities that lay in the
occurrence. This man was a commodore
in the United States navy; and
his name was not Perry, as the reader
may at first surmise, but John H.
Aulick. He was a Virginian, then in
his sixty-second year; he had had a
long and very honorable service, and
was keen and statesmanlike in his
ideas.</p>

<p>What Commodore Aulick saw in the
incident was this: The kind and
friendly reception of the Japanese
waifs in America, contrasted with the
ordinary treatment of white refugees
in Japan, might be taken advantage
of to open friendly relations with
Japan. To effect this result, a naval<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
expedition should be sent to Japan.
If properly conducted, the expedition
not only might secure friendly treatment
of American whalers on the
Japanese coasts, but might open up
trade relations with the country which
would be highly profitable.</p>

<p>Filled with his idea, which was
really a great one, Commodore Aulick
obtained permission to lay it before
the secretary of state, who was none
other than Daniel Webster. He had
an interview with Mr. Webster at
Washington on the 9th day of May,
1851.</p>

<p>Webster saw the point at once. At
his instance, President Fillmore ordered
the navy department to prepare
a small expedition for the voyage
to Japan; and when the ships
were ready&mdash;they were headed by the
sloop of war <i>Mississippi</i>&mdash;Commodore
Aulick was put in command. He actually
sailed on the voyage; but he
was entrusted with the task of taking
the Brazilian minister as far as Rio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Janeiro on the way, and some trouble
having arisen with this functionary
for which Commodore Aulick was
blamed, he was superseded in command
of the expedition by Commodore
Matthew Calbraith Perry, in
command of the <i>Hartford</i>.</p>

<p>It was Perry, therefore, who
"opened up Japan." His name will
be associated, as long as the story of
the two nations is told, with the event.
But it was Aulick's idea, not Perry's;
and it all hung upon the luck which
those Japanese fishermen, waifs upon
a boundless ocean, had in being picked
up by a generous Yankee skipper, and
in finding their way to so wholehearted
and so hospitable a city toward
"Mongolian" wanderers as San
Francisco was&mdash;then!</p>

<p>If this incident had not suggested
and been followed by the Aulick-Perry
expedition, what then? Russian authorities
have claimed that Russia was
preparing a similar expedition at the
time when Secretary Webster&mdash;"too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
zealous," according to their view&mdash;sent the
United States ships on their
way. There is good reason to believe
that the Russian government would
have been slow in making such an infinitely
clever move as the Perry expedition
constituted. Yet if the
United States had not taken the step,
Russia would have stood next in the
line of logical inheritance to the idea.
And if Japan had been opened under
Russian auspices, its doors, instead
of standing open toward the East,
and consequently toward <i>our</i> West,
would have opened toward the Asiatic
continental West, which would have
meant toward St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>If the Japanese had, under Russian
initiative, adopted the material adjuncts
of western civilization, as they
finally did under ours, that civilization
would have taken on a distinctly
Muscovite color. The Japanese would
never, indeed, have been able, under
such auspices, to organize an effective
resistance to Russian arms, for long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
before they had acquired the requisite
training they must have been held
firmly in the grip of the Russian military
system.</p>

<p>That is to say, Japan would have
been, step by step, annexed to the
Russian empire. The Russo-Japanese
war would never have been, since
there would have been neither hope
nor occasion for it. Most of the rich
fruits of Japanese art and industry
would have drifted toward Russia.
The Russian empire would have been
enormously enriched by the Japanese
trade, and the importance of that
empire immensely magnified in the
history of our epoch. A reflex orientalizing
influence would have rolled
over Russia itself, and the course of
Russian internal development altered
in a degree now almost incalculable.</p>

<p>If Russia had not been reasonably
prompt to take the step, the eyes of
British statesmen must sooner or
later have been opened to the opportunity.
The method by which British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
intervention proceeds in Asiatic countries
is well known. It has always
had but slight regard for native sovereignty,
no matter how high the
state of social or artistic or intellectual
development on the part of the
native races affected. British administrators,
or, if Japan had retained
its nominal sovereignty, British "residents"
or agents, would really have
governed the country through the
Tycoon or the Mikado, or both&mdash;preferably
the Tycoon, for he was a
military ruler, and affairs could have
been handled more readily through
him.</p>

<p>Events in Japan must have anticipated
the subsequent history of
Egypt, on a much more magnificent
scale. Again, though there would
have been a readier entrance for
American and European trade than
in the case of Russian intervention,
the best of everything Japanese would
certainly have gone to England. And
once again, the free, independent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
powerful, masterful Japanese empire
of the present day, thrilling with a
new life in which all the civilization
of the Occident is made the handmaid
of an ancient and undaunted Asiatic
people, would not have been.</p>

<p>In the unlikely event that the Japanese,
in default of Perry's expedition,
had been left quite alone for
another generation or two, their case
would not have been better in the
long run. They would simply have
missed the chance they got. Left a
"hermit nation," they would sooner
or later have fallen under the influence
of one Western country or another,
and been so seriously retarded
in the race of civilization that they
could never have caught up.</p>

<p>America was the only country that
could have opened to them the wonderful
career that they have had.
The high noon of the nineteenth century
was the golden moment for the
commencement of their development
along the line of Western civilization.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
If the hour had not struck then
for them it would not have struck at
all. Time, the helping hand, the protecting
influence of an unselfish friend
among the nations, and the golden
gift of destiny, were all represented
for Japan in the rescuing sails of
Skipper Jennings's bark, that lucky
day in the wide Pacific.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>IF ORSINI'S BOMB HAD NOT FAILED TO<br />
DESTROY NAPOLEON III</h3>


<p>Edward A. Freeman wrote,
after the fall of the second
Bonaparte empire: "The work of
Richelieu is utterly undone, the work
of Henry II and Louis XIV is partially
undone; the Rhine now neither
crosses nor waters a single rood of
French ground. As it was in the first
beginnings of northern European history,
so it is now; Germany lies on
both sides of the German river."
This was not by any means the whole
of the work wrought by that adventurer
on an imperial throne, Napoleon
III, through his disastrous war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
against a united Germany. He accomplished
also the slaughter of
five hundred thousand men, and the
impoverishment of millions. He
sounded the death knell of monarchical
adventuring in France, which was
indeed one good result of the Napoleonic
<i>débâcle</i>, but he also fastened
militarism, in the form of excessive
and progressively increasing peace
armaments, upon Europe, and magnified
public debts and taxation to the
limit of endurance.</p>

<p>Every event here mentioned was a
direct development, not of Napoleon
III's original seizure of the French
throne, but of the final years, and the
eventual overthrow of his power&mdash;the
overthrow itself due to the
Franco-Prussian war. A single event,
criminal in its character, might have
prevented these results. That great
benefits sometimes eventuate from
men's crimes is no news, and no
longer a marvel, to the philosopher,
who, when good comes of evil, is apt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
to repeat the words, "God moves in
a mysterious way his wonders to perform."</p>

<p>The evil deed to which I have here
referred, which would have saved the
lives of five hundred thousand people
and left the river Rhine still
washing the confines of France, was
the aiming of Orsini's bomb on the
evening of the 14th of January, 1858.
This bomb was designed to take the
life of the emperor of the French. If
the attempt had succeeded, and Napoleon
had died as Alexander II of
Russia and King Humbert of Italy
afterward died, there would have
been no Franco-German war. The
throne of the baby Napoleon IV, who
was then less than two years old, very
likely would not have endured long;
but whether the third republic had
immediately arisen, or whether the
Orleans Bourbons had been restored
to the throne, it would have been
found easy to preserve the peace with
Prussia and Germany.</p>

<p>For Napoleon III deliberat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>ely, and
with malignant ingenuity, provoked
war with Germany in 1870. There is
now no doubt that Bismarck desired
such a war. He afterward confessed
that he deceived the aged King William
in such a way that all chance
of peace at Ems was lost. But nevertheless
the provocation of Napoleon
was direct and deliberate.</p>

<p>His grievance was that the Hohenzollern
prince, Leopold, had consented
to become a candidate for the vacant
throne of Spain. King William withdrew
Prince Leopold's candidature.
This really destroyed Napoleon's pretext
for bringing on a war. But
he desired a foreign war in order to
forestall revolutionary opposition at
home, which threatened to become
irresistible. Napoleon thereupon
caused his ambassador, Benedetti, insolently,
and in a manner quite unbearable,
to demand personally from
King William a declaration that no
Hohenzollern should ever be permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
to become king of Spain. King
William treated this insolence as it
deserved, and France, thereupon, declared
war against Prussia.</p>

<p>What followed, the world knows.
The consequences were tremendous.
France was maimed of Alsace and
Lorraine. Half a million of the
flower of the manhood of both nations
perished. France taxed herself
with five millions of francs of indemnity,
and though she has paid the
debt to Germany, she still owes it to
her own citizens. The difficulties of
French government and finance were
increased prodigiously and indefinitely
by the war and the empire's
delinquencies.</p>

<p>And all as a result contingent upon
the failure of a criminal act! Felice
Orsini meant to kill Napoleon III, and
he and his two companions did kill
ten innocent persons, and did wound
one hundred and fifty others. Yet
the man for whom their bombs were
intended&mdash;the adventurer who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
once been their comrade as a member
of the Italian secret society, the Carbonari,
but who had afterward betrayed
the cause of Italian independence
by leading an army into the
peninsula and restoring the papal
power&mdash;escaped unharmed, to wind
the trail of his infamous conspiracies
through European politics for twelve
years longer. If the bomb had done
its direful work, one man, utterly
without character or conscience,
would have died, and five hundred
thousand men, mostly honest, good
and true, would have lived. As it
happened, the one man was spared, to
make a vast holocaust of human life
twelve years later.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, strange that the averting
of a single crime may sometimes
precipitate a myriad of other crimes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>IF PRESIDENT BUCHANAN HAD ENFORCED<br />
THE LAW IN NOVEMBER, 1860</h3>


<p>Speaking of the lighting of the
fires of civil war in this country
in the years 1860 and 1861, Charles
Francis Adams said, in 1873, "One
single hour of the will displayed by
General Jackson would have stifled
the fire in its cradle." The metaphor
in the last phrase is peculiar,
and strangely Celtic for a Yankee, but
the history is true.</p>

<p>Montgomery Blair expressed the
idea with greater plainness and vividness
in that same year, 1873, in these
words, "If we could have held Fort
Sumter, there never would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
a drop of blood shed." Both these
remarks were made by men who had
been in some sense actors in the
events to which they referred, and
made after years of reflection upon
the circumstances.</p>

<p>It does not seem to Americans of
the present generation that there was
ever a moment, after the election of
Abraham Lincoln, when the Civil
War could have been averted. It appears,
in retrospect, to have been absolutely
inevitable. Yet there was
certainly one moment when, if President
Buchanan had had the courage
to apply the general views which he
himself advanced in his annual message
to Congress of December 3, 1860,
and his special message of January 8,
1861, which explicitly denied the right
of secession, a halt might have been
called to the growing rebellion.</p>

<p>The secession movement was at
first concentrated in the State of
South Carolina. That State, all
through the winter of 1860-1861, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
presenting to the rest of the South an
object lesson of successful nullification.</p>

<p>In 1833 South Carolina had ordained
nullification, but its ordinance
was so instantly and heavily repressed
by President Andrew Jackson
that the State was absolutely unable
to carry it out, or to move hand
or foot. But now, in 1860, it did not
merely ordain nullification&mdash;it enacted
it. Every Federal judge, every
judicial servant, and nearly every
Federal official, in South Carolina, resigned,
and the nation was left without
an agent to enforce its laws, for
no new ones were sent in. The United
States authority in the State was at
an end, save for the custom house at
Charleston and Fort Moultrie in
Charleston harbor.</p>

<p>As long as South Carolina was let
alone, her case plainly said to all the
other slave States, "You see we can
withdraw from the Union; we have
withdrawn from the Union; and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Union takes no step to keep us in;
you can do the same thing."</p>

<p>At this time North Carolina and
Virginia were opposed to secession.
Governor Sam Houston, of Texas,
stood like a rock against it. Kentucky,
Maryland, Missouri, never seceded.
Other States were wavering.
A great deal depended on the degree
of success which South Carolina, the
leader in the revolt, might have. And
it was Buchanan who permitted South
Carolina's success to become apparently
complete, though in the message
to which I have referred the president
declared that secession was "wholly
inconsistent with the Constitution,"
that "no human power could absolve
him (the president) from his duty to
enforce the laws," and that the danger
of national disruption was upon the
country. Buchanan, in his December
message, actually quoted Jackson's
solemn denunciation of the doctrine
that a State had a right to separate
itself from the Union.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>But while he was making these terrible
admissions of his own duty,
what was Buchanan doing? Instead
of holding up the hands of the nation's
representatives in South Carolina,
he was weakening them. Instead
of strengthening the Federal
garrison in Charleston harbor, he permitted,
it to dwindle until it was
powerless to take a single step. Not
one act, indeed, did he perform, but
contented himself with calling on
Congress for legislation to meet the
emergency. And out of Congress, of
course, he could get nothing, for the
Southern representatives would vote
for no such legislation, and the Republican
members were bent upon
waiting until Lincoln, who had been
elected president, came in in March,
and the northern Democrats were
paralyzed with pusillanimity.</p>

<p>So South Carolina went on proving
to the other slave States that it could
"go it alone." One after another
these other States seceded from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Union. Northern arsenals were
stripped of arms. Southern officers
went out of the army one by one, and
made ready to organize the army of
the new Confederacy which was forming
under the president's nose.</p>

<p>It was a time for the strong arm,
and for quick, decisive, Jacksonian,
and not at all squeamish, action. But
no such action was taken. The golden
moment was lost, and when, three
months afterward, Lincoln came in
at last, war, with all its horrors, was
upon the country.</p>

<p>If the young rebellion had been
truly nipped in the bud, as it might
have been, by a rigid enforcement, in
November and December, 1860, of
Federal judicial processes in South
Carolina; if the laws of the United
States had been enforced in that State
at the point of the bayonet, if need
be; if a Federal functionary, sustained
by an ample force of United
States troops, had torn South Carolina's
ordinance of secession into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
shreds on the steps of the capitol at
Columbia, with no tender regard for
South Carolina's interpretation of the
Constitution, is it likely that South
Carolina's sister States would have
been so prompt at seceding?</p>

<p>Very likely it might not have been
necessary to do any of these things.
If Buchanan had merely stood up
and said, as Jackson did in 1833, "I
shall enforce the laws of the United
States in spite of any and all resistance
that may be made," there might
well have been no more of secession
in 1860 or 1861 than there had been
of real nullification in 1833.</p>

<p>And if this step had been taken,
and there had been no war, what
then? What about slavery? it may
be asked. Is it conceivable that
northern sentiment would have permitted
chattel slavery to continue?
Was not war inevitable on that main
question alone? Let us see. The sentiment
for absolute and sudden emancipation
was the product of the war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Lincoln was not an Abolitionist. The
Republican party was not Abolitionist.</p>

<p>Without war, but with the Southern
States held within the Union, sentiment
in the North would have been
favorable to a compromise which
would have prevented the extension
of slavery; and events would surely
have brought about a gradual liberation
of the blacks in the South, as
events soon ended slavery in Brazil
and Cuba. The institution was
doomed, morally and economically.</p>

<p>But there would have been no negro
suffrage. That was enforced by conditions
which grew out of the war.
The South would not have been impoverished,
and it could have afforded
a gradual education of the
negro in such a way as to fit him for
free industry, and, in a limited way,
for the exercise of the suffrage.
There would have been no disturbing
reversal of the position of the two
races, to be followed by a violent restoration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of white supremacy and an
accompanying development of inveterate
hostility between whites and
blacks. The sections would not have
drifted apart in industrial conditions
and social constitution as they did
under the influence of the war; we
should not have had, perhaps, a
money-mad North to counterbalance
a ruined, desolated, disheartened
South.</p>

<p>And where, at Antietam, at Gettysburg,
at Fredericksburg, at Chattanooga,
and on many humbler fields,
the flags wave over the even ranks of
myriads of soldier graves, the mocking-birds
would sing in thickets which
the bullet's hiss and the shriek of the
shell had never profaned, while their
teeming populations of dead men
would either be alive to-day or entombed
among their loved ones after
lives of peaceful usefulness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>IF THE CONFEDERATES HAD MARCHED ON<br />
WASHINGTON AFTER BULL RUN</h3>


<p>There have been a great many
attempts to excuse or minimize
the failure of General Joseph
E. Johnston to follow up the tremendous
Confederate victory won by his
second in command, General G. T.
Beauregard, at Bull Run, July 21,
1861. That the Federal army was
beaten literally to a pulp there can
be no doubt. General Irwin McDowell,
who commanded the Union
forces, officially reported, after the
battle, that all his troops were in
flight "in a state of utter disorganization."
"They could not," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
wired on July 22d, "be prepared for
action by to-morrow morning even
were they willing. The larger part of
the men are a confused mob, entirely
demoralized." They were actually
running away in such a state of panic
that they could not get away, for
commissary and ammunition wagons,
congressmen's and other spectators'
horses and carriages, artillery and
sutlers' wagons were blocking the
road, and panicstricken soldiers were
falling over one another. When General
McClellan came to take command
after McDowell had been superseded,
he reported this state of affairs: "I
found no army to command&mdash;a mere
collection of regiments cowering on
the banks of the Potomac, some perfectly
raw, others dispirited by defeat."</p>

<p>To reach the spot where the beaten
raw recruits were thus cowering,
General Johnston and General Beauregard
had to advance only twenty
miles, over a road every foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
which was well known to them. That
the Federal army was in ignominious
flight they were well aware, for they
reported it joyfully to the government
at Richmond. Why did they
settle down into utter inaction and
allow McClellan to fortify the capital
and organize, drill and inspire with
hope and confidence a great army?</p>

<p>There are a good many "ifs" in
connection with the actual fighting
of the battle of Bull Run, but this
"if" that comes after it&mdash;if the elated
and triumphant Confederate army
had immediately advanced to the
Potomac, invested the intrenchments
at Arlington Heights and, very likely,
effected a crossing above or near the
Great Falls of the river, and flanked
the capital of the Union&mdash;is the greatest
and most interesting of them all.</p>

<p>General Beauregard actually commanded
at the battle on the 21st, because
General Johnston, who ranked
him, had but just arrived on the
scene and was unfamiliar with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
ground and the disposition of the
troops. But he, Johnston, became responsible
for the further prosecution
of the campaign, once the battle was
won. It was in large measure his
fault that the fruits of victory were
not reaped.</p>

<p>The commonly accepted explanation
of the matter is that the Confederates
were "almost as much disorganized
by victory as the Federals
were by defeat;" that they had no
fresh troops and no cavalry with
which to pursue, and that Arlington
Heights were too well fortified to be
attacked.</p>

<p>But General Beauregard, sore at the
attempt to rob him of the laurels of
victory, has been able to show that
all of the Confederate brigades of
Ewell, Holmes, D. R. Jones and Longstreet,
and two regiments of Bonham's
brigade, were perfectly fresh
and unharmed after the fight; that
Early's brigade had hardly been under
fire; that new regiments had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
come up during the day; that the
fresh troops in all numbered at least
fifteen thousand; that more than half
the Confederate army, in fact, had not
been engaged&mdash;a very unusual proportion
after an important battle.
"The remaining forces, after a night's
rest," says Beauregard himself,
"would have been instantly reorganized
and found thoroughly safe to
join the advance."</p>

<p>Apparently nothing but shame on
the Northern side, and an unwillingness
on the Southern side to discredit
their great generals, has prevented a
full acknowledgment of the fatal tactics
which prevented an advance on
the Potomac after Bull Run.</p>

<p>Now let us see what would have resulted
from a Confederate investment
of Washington in the summer of 1861.
Federal troops had already been attacked
in the streets of Baltimore.
That city was preponderantly disloyal,
and had to be garrisoned with
Union troops. Missouri had not yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
been won to the Union. Maryland,
Delaware and Kentucky, all of which
were necessary to the maintenance of
the Northern position, were slave
States, and their loyalty was doubtful.
If the capital of the Union had
been taken, all these States, in spite
of their previous unwillingness to
join the secession movement, would
probably have been impelled by
strong self-interest to range themselves
on the side of the other slave
States; and the Confederacy would
have been strengthened by the addition
of at least four States.</p>

<p>There was an important party
among the Confederates from the
western Southern States&mdash;it was led
by Postmaster-General John H. Reagan
and included General Albert Sidney
Johnston&mdash;who believed in advancing
at the very outset into Kentucky
and making the Ohio River the
first line of Southern defense. The
plan was rejected by Davis and his
advisers. It was an unfortunate rejection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
The Confederacy was finally
beaten because it was flanked in the
west and cut in two at Vicksburg.
But if Washington had been captured
or invested after Bull Run, it
is certain that the Confederate line
would have been pushed to the Ohio,
and it would probably have been held
there. The advantage gained by McClellan
in West Virginia would have
been lost, for he would practically
have found himself within the Confederate
lines and would have been
compelled to withdraw into Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Even as matters were, the position
of the Union was highly precarious
all through the summer and autumn
of 1861. There were signs of a demand
for peace in the North. Lincoln's
own party was turning against
him. The sympathy of Europe was
rapidly passing over to the Confederacy.
But so long as Lincoln stood
firm in the White House and Congress
sat at the capital, "the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
at Washington still lived,"
and the people felt it. The truce so
kindly, so inexplicably permitted by
Davis and Lee and Johnston enabled
McClellan to organize and drill a
great army, to fortify the capital, to
spread renewed confidence in the
North, and, in short, to establish a
fulcrum for future victory.</p>

<p>This was not the last time that opportunity
knocked at the door of the
Confederacy. It knocked again, and
loudly, as will be shown in the next
chapter, the same year. Either event,
taken alone, appears decisive. For
as we contemplate the events of the
21st of July, 1861, it quite appears
as if the flag of two republics&mdash;three,
perhaps, and conceivably four&mdash;might
have been flying over this great
American domain to-day if Johnston
had pressed his advance down the
Warrenton turnpike early Monday
morning, July 22d. Wars, divisions,
European intrusion, retrogression and
darkness would have been America's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
fate, instead of that imperial advance,
with liberty and union, which has
dazzled and heartened the whole
world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>IF THE CONFEDERATE STATES HAD<br />
PURCHASED THE EAST INDIA<br />
COMPANY'S FLEET IN 1861</h3>


<p>In the preceding chapter I have
noted the disastrous consequences
of the rejection of John H.
Reagan's plan, urged at Montgomery
at the very foundation of the Confederacy,
for the prompt occupation
of the south bank of the Ohio River
as the advanced line of defense, and
the equally unfavorable result of the
failure of Johnston to press on to the
Potomac after the great success at
Manassas. Gettysburg was a pivotal
combat, also; for if Lee had been
supported by Stuart's cavalry on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
occasion, there is at least a possibility
that the war's tide might have been
turned then and there.</p>

<p>But there was a narrower contingency
than either one of these. To a
positively decisive extent, the success
of the National forces in subjugating
the Southern States turned on
the sea power. The conquest of the
Confederacy was in fact a matter of
supreme difficulty as it was; and if
the South had possessed a respectable
navy, and had been able to keep its
ports open and steadily exchange its
cotton in Europe for the materials
and munitions of war, the conquest
would not have been possible at all.</p>

<p>The chance for the establishment
of such a navy lay within the grasp
of the Confederate statesmen, and was
by them let slip. Neither they, nor
any one else at the time, realized how
easy the thing would have been.</p>

<p>It is first necessary to explain in
what situation the National government
was, at the outset of the war,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in the matter of a naval force. Nominally
the United States navy consisted
of ninety vessels, but of these
fifty were utterly obsolete and unusable
except as supply ships. Of the
other forty, twenty were in a state of
hopeless unreadiness. Several of the
best ships were in the remotest corners
of the world. The home squadron
was composed of twelve ships, of
which only seven were steamers!
Nearly fifty years after the invention
of steam navigation, the United States
depended principally upon sailing
vessels for its defense. Only three
trustworthy warships were left in
Northern waters for the defense of
such ports as New York, Boston and
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>As between the North and the
South, the chance to wield the sea
power lay with the one of the two
rival governments which should first
put on the water even a very small
fleet of ironclad, steam-driven vessels.
The Confederacy proved afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
what power could be exerted in
this direction with but one single
ironclad, when the <i>Merrimac</i> destroyed
or scattered all the ships in
Hampton Roads, for a moment threatened
Washington and the Northern
cities with ravage, and was checked
at last only by the almost providential
appearance of another ironclad,
Ericsson's little <i>Monitor</i>, on the
scene. And the <i>Alabama's</i> armor of
chains made her for a time almost
a match for the United States navy.</p>

<p>By what means could the Confederacy
have forestalled the North in
the provision of a really effective
navy? The chance, as I have said,
was offered, and declined, with fatal
want of foresight. It lay in the ten
steamships of the English East India
Company, which in 1861 was winding
up its affairs. These ships were
offered to the Confederacy at a fair
valuation. They were very good vessels,
and capable of prompt armoring
in at least as effective a style as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
in which the <i>Alabama</i> was afterwards
armored. The East India Company
was prepared to make such terms as
the Confederate government could
have met.</p>

<p>British outfitters were perfectly
willing to trust the Southern statesmen.
The ships could have been
armed in a few weeks; there was
nothing to prevent their entrance
into Southern ports, for the blockade
was not made effective until one year
after the war broke out. The <i>Otero</i>,
renamed by the Confederates the
<i>Florida</i>, had no difficulty in taking
on her men and guns in the Bahamas.</p>

<p>Possessed of ten good steam vessels,
commanded by such men as
Maury, Maffitt of the <i>Florida</i>, and
Semmes of the <i>Alabama</i>, the Confederacy
could have quickly overcome
its lack of mechanics and workshops
by importation from Europe. It was
the command of the Mississippi, the
Cumberland and the Tennessee rivers
which "broke the back of the Confederacy";<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and does any one imagine
that the wooden ships of Farragut
could have entered the Mississippi,
compelled the abandonment of New
Orleans, and secured the possession
of not only the seacoast but the inland
river waters which commanded
the Confederacy from the rear, if there
had been any good ships to resist
him?</p>

<p>The start which these ten ships
would have given a Confederate navy
would have more than put the South
even with the North on the sea. It
must be remembered that up to 1862,
even as it was, the South could do better
in the courts and exchanges of
Europe than the Union could. Why?
Because the South had the cotton,
upon which the mills of Europe depended.
The continued chance to
market cotton would have saved the
situation for the South. <i>Alabamas</i> in
any requisite number would have issued
from British shipyards.</p>

<p>As it was, several powerful rams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
were under construction for the Confederacy
in 1861 and 1862 in the yards
of the Lairds. But the continued insistence
of Minister Adams on the
unlawfulness of this proceeding,
joined with the fact that the Confederates
had no recognizable navy to
back up their purchases, at last compelled
the British government to take
these rams over and add them to its
own sea power.</p>

<p>President Jefferson Davis declined
the offer of the East India ships for
the apparent reason that the military
necessities of the Confederacy pressed
hard upon the financial resources of
the new government. Every member
of his government was quite thoroughly
convinced that the National
power could not successfully invade
the South, provided a strong army
were quickly put into the field. The
ready material for good soldiers was
much more abundant in the South
than in the North; nearly all Southern
men were horsemen, hunters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
marksmen, out-of-door men. On the
other hand, the first levies from the
North were mostly city men, unaccustomed
to firearms, strangers to exposure,
flabby of physique. Manassas
amply illustrated the great superiority
as soldiers of the first comers from
the South over the first comers from
the North.</p>

<p>The Confederate leaders counted
upon making permanent the advantage
which they were confident of
gaining in the field at the outset. To
purchase out of hand ten steamships,
from resources that were yet to be
created, and with the manhood of
seven States demanding to be armed,
looked, indeed, like madness. And
yet this was the very card which, if
played, would have saved the Confederacy's
game.</p>

<p>Conceive for a moment the Union
navy debarred from entrance into the
James or any of the navigable waters
of Virginia, to support military
operations in the direction of Richmond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Conceive Wilmington, N. C.,
which was an easily defensible port,
and which really remained open to
the blockade runners for almost two
years after the beginning of the war,
rendered a fairly safe point of departure
for European trade throughout
the war. Conceive the Mississippi,
from Cairo southward to its
mouth, continuously under the power
of the Confederacy, with a fleet of
river gunboats backed up by a Gulf
squadron. Does any one imagine that
in that case the North could have
made either any warlike or commercial
use of the Ohio, the Cumberland,
the Tennessee, or even the Mississippi
from Cairo up to St. Louis?</p>

<p>Freed from the unceasing coast
menace and from the danger of being
cut in two along the rivers, the effectiveness
of the land forces would have
been more than doubled. Leaving out
of the account the possibility of offensive
operations against Washington
and the cities of the North, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
defense of the seceded States could
have been made so secure that the
people of the North would have called
loudly for peace; the border slave
States would have cast in their lot
with the Confederacy, and England
and France would have openly sided
with the South; secession would have
triumphed definitely before the end
of the year 1863.</p>

<p>With the English East India Company,
it was a case of "take our
ships or leave them." The South left
them, and with them it left its chance
for independence and for putting two
mediocre American republics in the
place where one great one, after that
decisive moment, was bound to stand
forever.</p>
